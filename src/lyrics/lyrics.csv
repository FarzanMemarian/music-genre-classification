But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

I'll work myself to death for you
Just to show I adore you
Nothing I wouldn't do for you

'Cause my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide
And it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

All I ever, ever hope to be
Depends on your love for me
Baby, believe me
If you should leave me
I'd be nothing but an empty shell
I know darn well, I can tell, now

I don't know much
But I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch

And my love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river running soul deep

My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
My love is a river running soul deep
Way down inside me, it's-a soul deep
Well, my love is a river running soul deep

Every girl has a somehing smile

If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls

Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something

When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight

Relax and let that something through

And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again

Blow up all the stores

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste
Like french cigarettes
And these coloured drinks
That you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

It's dripping off your face, and you're losing your precious mind


Send me a postcard if you get that far
You got a couple pennies in your rusty jar
The truth you've been gone for awhile
It's hard looking at you when you look that way
With your one night stands and your sleep all days
Ooh, you're such a slut sometimes




You're losing your mind

So I can't let ya snatch the powder out my hourglass

Everyday that I'm awake I face the angel of death
He may be taken my breath, so they can lay me to rest
And by now my inner state's the only place that I rep
The way that I dress is just another way to express
We know that some day everybody we see will be dead and rotten
Long forgotten, we oughta keep this for a normal topic
Because we all get caught up in all the drama
But what's the gossip gonna mean, when me and you are goners
See I never did audition for a part in this play

I'll lend a hand to a hurt pedestrian and I will help a friend
In any way that I can, but I can't let man get up in the way of my plans
Make me stray from my path, I can't be takin' that chance

His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat


He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale


She was crossing the street to the box over the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke

I'm throwing down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity

See, my lyrics I'm doubling up and proving to suckers that I can throw em
I'm passing a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go

Never tricks, the DJ Quikster steals the show

But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't going never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N

The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

I know it's only, only three little words I seem to be so scared of
So please show me how to get these words off the tip of my tongue and out of my mind


I know you're the one for me but it took me by surprise
And If I say it back to you, I can't look you in the eye
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to confuse you
I guess that this is my cue, to give you my reply


And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it, you killed it
With I love you
And you killed with I love you
What am I supposed to say back to you?
You killed it with I love you
With I love you


I have been thinking about what you said
Three little words running round in my head
There's no one else that I'd rather be next to
I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you



And you killed it, you killed it
You killed it with I love you
And you killed it, you killed it

She gave me trouble all my life
She ran me out in the cold rain and snow

She came a running on down the stairs
Combing back her long yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, as a rose

Well I ain't got no use for your red apple juice

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor

I guess I changed my mind

Disregards the bombs and satellites

The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down
It's all in your mind""

I'm looking forward to this life I live

You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over

They justify my claim
And the public don’t turn on
My transmission ‘cause it wasn’t televised

They say the Nile used to run from East to West

He recovered from his sleep
So strong was his urge to test his might
But still he was too weak

Who has no rites of passage undergone
He cannot rule the thunder
The first step is always to humble
And to learn the might of the gods

Anger he felt, grabbed a thunderbolt
And across the heavens hate echoed!

An adolescent he is to ride a stormy cloud
So young to carry the faintest bolt of lightning
Alone he walks his path of honour
Such skill wasted in lack of strength

Too bold he was to learn - a grand punishment
Deserved

And across the heavens hate echoed!

Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know

Dwells a pretty little maiden all alone
And she's thinking of her true love though he's far off cross the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby...

The owl and the dead boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children

Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way
To lose myself into a tale


Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end


A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone
Bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby

Come undone
Bring me back to life

Journey homeward bound
The sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The Tower my sole guide

This is who I am
Escapist
Paradise seeker
Farewell, time to fly
Out of sight
Out of time
Away from all lies


A nightingale in a golden cage

I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change

Oh my baby’s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don’t know if I’m a wounded heart

I’ve seen a lot of heartache and I’ve walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn’t crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I’ll be gone

When you were standing there
Set in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
Cause there was nothing there
That you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time

I have never been so far out in front
That I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time
Knowing this you found a thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before
And memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you seem me to be
I've set you free this time

I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to win or a thing to lose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
There was only something
You can look at lying in your hand

And why it can not be arranged
To have each thing work fine

Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take him? Fuck..


Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you? Slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?


Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware


Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me


It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?


Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane


You are talking to yourself we are one of the same


It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?


Easy, my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand this and the clever will use it


Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you


If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God


Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?


Yes but few use more than one tenth of the minds capacity


I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain


Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings are real, erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth


But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?


In order for anything to exist, so must its opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest


But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?


The process of all life
Is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self


Is God a he or she is there one true religion?


I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living


If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag

Chorus 2x

Verse 3: (A-Butta)

I swear there's a war brewing in the air in New York streets
You talk beef? Catch a swollen melon
This ghetto rumbles, with loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, dropping bombs
Prepare to crumble
As we rock on, beware the jungle, with Anacondas
Don't puff too much, cause adversaries smell the Marijuana
We blasting every object in combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blasting
We blowing heat 'til each member of your fleet are has-beens
Soldiers banging, whose click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory, from the tip of the tongue
Who gets laced physically? Take the clip for the gun
And put it in, cause when it's on, how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pulling for breath, I'm claiming your death
You shouldn't've stepped
War paint on my chest, fatigues green and black
The heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasing caps 'til the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on

Yo no quiero que me hablen
De pena ni sufrimiento
Yo quiero vivir mi vida
Alegre, feliz, contento
El dia que yo me muera
No quiero llanto ni rezo
Que me lleven a mi Cali
A Barranquilla y el Puerto

Que traigan mucho aguardiente
Queden todos bien contentos

Y que bailen mis hermanos
A la memoria del muerto
Y que bailen mis amigos
A la memoria del muerto

A la memoria del muerto

With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hadn in mine
It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears

Chorus
We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride

Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile

With those butterfly first time feelings you've always kept me on the edge of my seat

What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

Just another lesson learned...

(And so it goes..)
At least I think was here asleep
Is it possible? Conceivable?
That I sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berserk?


In slid rhythm, fed a cycle bound by dilemma, debt, and vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment to park in front a fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
Contestants get the New York home game with real life shoot 'em up-action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie and art freak game piece all included
I told this cat the Earth was flat, he walked 'till his beard grew
Long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
It's bric-a-brac novelties, spliced with that six pack odyssey
Godspeed, tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelers spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'm a never give, I'm juiced off projection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed, I bait this data for my pledge
To bathe a traitor of the twice forgotten favors that he bled
And not a creature stirred
It reeks of subway metal, bevel edged journalist chin-on-fist shenanigans
Re-coin mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future clenched adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in the circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds
To see which one could track your trail and serve you, sucker
I lay the law down upon its belly while my foot
Dug in between the 3rd and 4th disc yelling ""Break yo' self!""
I finally actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement, but a far fetch from stability
Took a hard pledge early on
Blood donor to drum dozer, plowing the metronome, home
Blown caddy-cornered to cockeyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph
Stabbing away on stone tablet to sketch a grouchy future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down
Sample of cancelled development, courtesy America
Land of the freebase, home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt caught pinball blinker and citizens 1-x
Weren't steadied for this leaning grievance with dilapidated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece and sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper out hierarchy
Passionate while they whine on some ""Daddy's gonna kill Ralphie"" shit
Suck the proverbial silver spoon 'till their parents quit apparently
Parasol spinning casually like
""I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me""
OK, time to buckle the fuck down
Solder your wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You could catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy-of-life logic don't employ the spite process
Hence your plight botches

The shepherd with his flock
The miner with his coal
We're in this together...and ever...

When we die, do we haunt the sky?
Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? Are we born again?
Just to sit asking questions like these?
I know, for I told me so
And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:
The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The Mystery of Roll!
The darning of the sock
The scoring of the goal!
The farmer takes a wife
The barber takes a pole
We're in this together...and ever...

They said, ""Come on, Ma let's go to the cabaret""

Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it
No Diggity, don't stop get busy
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as
I realize you was just misleadin me
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me




Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead
On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread
That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread
I tried to intervene you said it was over my head
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man
Right, but I'm tryin to keep you in my life
V.I.A. satellite, talkin them burn outs
Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out
Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets
Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet
And one night you asleep after work was chopped up
Felt somethin strange in my veins, I popped up
One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone

I pledge resistance to the grass
That hides the snakes of America
So they watch it, now I walk with caution
More careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
But I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
War is big biz, ask an economist
Speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
But cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me

We call it art, some call it a crime
It's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
On drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
The villain trained by the hero for the killing
Now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
They might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
Just listen to the knowledge I give
If more than half the budget goes to military spending

He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie

The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars
He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn

On the way to the ancient castle of time
He will soon be damned by rage
So that his pride could betray him
When it's time to set him free

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty


Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history


How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand

Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world


How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh


Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony


A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

Yo cierro los ojos y veo tu cara
Que sonríe cómplice de amor
Días en la carretera
Yo siento aquí dentro
La emoción de haber
Dejado lo mejor


Yo no se si es en vano éste amor


Aquí no hay luces de escena
Y algo en mi no se serena, no


Yo ya no comprendo nada
Tantas caras dibujadas
Como manchas en una pared
Noches de melancolía
Pateando en una ciudad vacía
En la oscuridad te busco a vos


Quizás hoy si te pueda encontrar


Mas allá de toda pena
Siento que la vida es buena hoy


Yo se que no es en vano este amor


Mas allá de toda pena
Siento que la vida es buena hoy

Eternamente estoy perdido

Invítame a devorarlo
A cobijarlo con mis besos

Voy cayendo lentamente

Si acaso me meto en aprietos tambien
Llevo el número de los bomberos

Ay man, let me ask you somethin,' man
You ever have one of them days where you felt like you mighta got rid of all the bad seeds in your life?
Y'knahmean? Like you just got your paycheck, paid off a car note or somethin'?
Just jumped out the shower feelin fresh than a muthafucka wit'cha good shoes on, y'knahmtalkinbout?


You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?


Like a Cadillac, like you ready to throw a party, like call e'rybody you know, don't even plan it, just do it


In Compton we call that spur of the moment


Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?


Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-forn-I day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
For a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, Quik break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Report
My baby momma ain't trippin on child support


Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
As a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
Over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells 'cut'
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up


It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
 And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
 From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright


Now on Aranbe and Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin' on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shaka and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass Henn be
And hemp be, the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply


So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood's throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight




It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite gipper
Can't nothin go wrong 'cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill


Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid, it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm more apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the Freaknik
Trick, what'chu workin with?

We get off with a bang
Your reckless obsession
Washed away all your shine

I'm you disease

You embrace my infection
When I cross your lips
You pretend not to notice
When I tighten my grip
I'm your brand-new monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease

I'm your disease

I could never ignore you
Any time that we meet
No sign of it slowin'
When you're dead on your feet
I'm your brand-new monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease

About a blindfolded angel
Who never learned the right from wrong
And though I don't know enough English
To describe its troubled mind
But for one thing I am certain
Is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figure him out
But I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him, drawing him
Analyzing him in every way
I could possibly think of

But that does not really help me
You gotta sit back and enjoy
You know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him
Now he sits there all alone
With his soul and his legend
And his epic melodies

And they are with us when we bleed
Yes, they are with us when we're crying
And they are with us when we bleed

Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strenght
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
Branching off through time
Two lone-wolves shared
The utmost silence of the time
(run, run the pathways as you share
The uttermost of silence)

Looking in to the heart of it

Del viejo y querido pueblo
Donde se abrieron mis ojos... distancia

Un corazón de guitarra quisiera

Allí viví la alegría... distancia

Entre la niebla del tiempo
Primer amor de mi vida... distancia
Que no pasó del intento;
Primer poema del alma... distancia

That I was through with sitting still
I stood up and started moving
With a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks
And the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction
Put my fist around the railing
And each step was far apart
And far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner
Until I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me
There were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway
But I knew that it was there
And on the last step I was dizzy
Because there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door
And through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes
Without a ceiling
Everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger
And suddenly I saw that I was
Upstairs and outside and freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling, and the truth

That I'm small
That I'm small
That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I done learned from mistakes like who's my man, and who's not
Like who's gone run, and who's not
Like who's gone shoot if you shot
Who gone hold they own, who's not
Who gone change spots


In the streets of New York, you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12-guage shotty
Loyalty comes free, and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me, you gotta leave here with a body

When I was ten years old, I seen a nigga take three in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed awake, cause my nightmares was seein' 'em dead
Smelled the burnt tires peelin' after leavin' him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin' on blast
I just stared at him, slumped in the grass
Arms movin', fingers shakin', spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
There I stood, stiffer than wood
See homey used to buy me candy
Now he's gone, who gone provide his family?
My ear ringing, shoulda been runnin'
I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn, I wasn't 'posed to see that shit
That's when I thought
It was more than three shots
He coulda been aimin' for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around at my pops, he like ""what happened?""
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin'
I can still hear him laughin'




It was a regular day in South Side, sprinklers and kids runnin'
All of a sudden, heads turnin', somebody did somethin'
This nigga name I forgot, fuck it, he lived around the block
Regular gettin' money nigga, but loved to clown a lot
Walked across the park, stuntin', frontin'
Diamonds in his ear, diamond watch on
Eatin' a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty, grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away, so he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected, shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy, told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't pay her no mind
Called her a bitch about four times
Stayed in the park, wit' no niggas wit' em and no nine
And them in no time, older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat, left his face all crack
Told him ""Take all that!""
Hit him again, popped his chain wit' a frown
And left the clown, with a stain on the ground




Now all my days go by blowin' that sticky, icky
California made me picky
Chicken head tried to stick me wit' a hickey
If we, blow up quickly, stickly, somewhere tipsy
The location don't matter, I'm South Side until they hit me
I'll be DEAD
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know Scarface or Bushwick Bill
My heart spills
For the kids that ain't got nothin' ain't got it still
And for my, cousin I lost
Humped over the steerin' wheel

Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle
And the pale light of the moon
Through the windows of the room
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled

We're taking our chances here on the run

For Iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
No, nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
And nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can

Whose useful days were gone and passed
He told me in a cardboard tone
How long ago he once had flown

When I was young he did relate
I'd watch the birds as they'd escape
From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...

What kind of bird am I?
How can I learn to fly?

And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of led
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea

This was my greatest, strongest wish
And so the air did not resist
One day above the ground I rose
And felt the air beneath my toes

What kind of boy am I?
How can I learn to fly?

I rose above the tallest trees
And summersalted in the breeze
I dove with lightning speed and then
I shot up to the clouds again

I jumped off buildings with delight
And laughed at those afraid of heights
What need has anyone for fear
When we are free and the sky is near?

Oh, what a boy was I?
When do we learn to die?

And when I saw I was alone
And no one close to me would come
I soon forgot the joy of sky
And gently back to earth came I

I've never flown again, said he
Because we're all alike, you see
Our sickness strengthens unity
And no one needs to question me

What kind of boy was I?
How could I learn to fly?

But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes

That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

I'm gonna ask him to dance
(And if he won't dance)
Another panic attack
(At least I said how I feel)


The very next night
I see him once more
It's not love at first sight
It's more like lust encore
He's floating my way
And I'm hoping to catch his eye
I'm not sure what to say
Damn it, this time, he will be mine




Oohhhh, I'm so sick
Of all this indecision
And the way, that just one look
Can rock my body rhythm


He's coming towards me
At least I hope that's the case
He's smiling at me
And my pulse starts to race
He's asking my name
Politely he turns to my friend
He's asking her the same
(Oh no)
God Almighty will this tourment never ever ... end?

Some people think we don't have the right
To say it's my country
Before they give in, they'd rather fuss and fight
Than say it's my country
I've paid three hundred years or more
Of slave driving, sweat, and welts on my back
This is my country

Doo doo doo

Too many have died in protecting my pride
For me to go second class
We've survived a hard blow and I want you to know
That you'll face us at last
And I know you will give consideration
Shall we perish unjust or live equal as a nation

"SOJWNDG12AB018235E","Nathalie, j’ai fait sa connaissance dans un pip-show
Mais n’allez pas croire que j'sois client d’ce genre d’endroit
Moi je n'suis qu’un honnête, laveur de carreaux
Mais faut bien prendre le boulot là où y’en a !

Non, non Nathalie, ne faisait pas de strip-tease en cabine
Elle démarchait, pour vendre de la lingerie féminine
Des portes jarretelles et des p'tites culottes en dentelles
Des bas noirs en soie, et des soutien-gorges sans bretelles

Mais l’établissement trouvait ces articles démodables
Préféré les godemichés, les poupées gonflables…
En sortant je l’ai vu qui pleurait comme une madeleine
Et moi pour la consoler, je lui ai dit : « je vous aime ! »

Nathalie il faut l’avouer n’était pas une professionnelle
Les dessous qu’elle vendait, elle n’en avait pas un sur elle !
Mais par contre quand, timidement, un garçon
Venait la voir juste pour lui demander son prénom

Elle n'faisait pas de manière et donnait sans façon
Son numéro de téléphone et ses mensurations
Les heures auxquelles ont pouvait la trouver chez elle
Et le calendrier de ses cycles menstruels

Puis voilà, le pire arriva, un jour elle attrapa l’sida
Elle se demandait bien comment elle avait choper ça
Dans le quartier tous les culs coincés et les culs bénis
Remerciaient le ciel que cette salope soit punie

Pourtant pendant qu’elle faisait l’amour aux hommes
Elle, au moins, elle ne faisait chier personne
C’était pas la vierge marie qui leur filait des érections
Mais bien Nathalie quand elle passait sous leur balcons

Ils étaient pleins aux as, mais ils n’avaient pas les moyens
De s’payer une fille, qui ne leur demandait rien !
Elle ignorait les conseils, des gens de la calotte
Attentive à c’que ses amants portent tous la capote

Elle était bien gentille, mais elle n’était pas idiote
Voilà pourtant maintenant deux ans qu’elle est morte !
Comment avait elle choper ça ? Ça reste un mystère, une énigme
Puis on se souvint d’une transfusion sanguine…

Y’avait un monde fou a l’enterrement de Nathalie
Tous ses anciens amants étaient là malgré la pluie
Seuls manquaient ceux, qui l’avaient baisée vraiment
Laurent Fabius et Garreta étaient absents...

Gonna start a new racket
Gonna start it out right
Gonna sell moonshine in the day

Goin' a catch the Santa Fe
Goin'a drink good liquor

Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
I don't think y'all heard me!
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!
Every day the 14th!
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see
Cupid grabs the pistol (Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here!)
He shoots straight for your heart
And he won't miss you!
That's alright y'all won't believe in me anyways
But


Ya won't believe in me, but you would fancy
Leprechauns or groundhogs
No thank you, Easter Bunny
(There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme)


Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th! (You got it!)
When Cupid knocks at your door
You can't ignore me!
There's no need to run!
So, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!)
Every day the 14th!
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what loves mean, well
Well, somebody tell me!
'Cuz they just don't believe in me!

(Cupid Valentino)
(There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated!)


Happy Valentine's Day
Every day the 14th!
Now I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now I understand cause I use to be a bad boy in my day
I know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away!
Ho, oh


Ya' won't believe in me, but you would fancy
(Hey! Don't you supposed to be some kind of player or something?)
Bunny!


Well keep on running player
Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you going to find out tonight!


Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella'
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet so may the force be with you
And I'll hit you when better time permits
For now show me samples, examples of why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

The weeds were high when Daddy took to drinkin'
Then him and Lucy Walker
They took up and run away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children
I swear you'll never see a hungry day

When Mama sacrificed her pride
The neighbors started talking
But I was much too young to understand a thing they said
The things that mattered most of all was Mama's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed

Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night
A hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

When Daddy left and destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So let 'em gossip all they want
She loved us and she raised us
The proof is standing here
A full grown man

Last summer Mama passed away
And left the ones who loved her
Each and every one was more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday she receives a fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
And a card that says, ""The greatest Mom on earth""

Dreamin' of the days of murder and locked in cartel
Drive bys, date rapes and weight like bar bells
I slit my girls throat dumped in McCart's well
Oh well, it's what i thought at the time
Cause in my own mind, it didn't like a crime
It seemed to be fine, all it was, was good times
Shoot a bitch, snort a line at the drop of a dime
Matter of fact the local mob was my first job
It's kinda easy when you killin' to rob
At least I wasn't sittin' home being a slob
I got up off my ass started climbin' to the top
They callin' me a demon and I'm asking how can I be
I know I got a heart, just lack of humanity
But now my sanity is something I ain't seen in a while
Sittin' on death row, this is my green mile


Locked up ain't where I wanna be
Confined in my mind is like a prison to me
Since birth had nothin' to choose
I'm on the run with a gun with nothin' to lose



Childhood is the blame, poverty stricken
Acid defacs in the mix and watch the plot thicken
I was sick of being poor, sick of just living
Sick of depression and that trailor park prison
That mama had me struckin' and where was my dad
I think that he forgot about the son that he had
So the chances of survival were none to slim
And mama keeps saying I remind her of him
So if I'm just like my dad then I'm going to be broke
Pulled a kick door, stabed my neighbour in the throat
I set off on my journey to see what I could find
I watched scarface and knew the world was mine
As far back as I recall I was fearless
But now my death is near and it's clear that I fear this
I know that satan is waitin'
And I ain't found heaven
So I put my salvation in this chrome Mac 11





It's about that time, I hear 'em comin down the line
My cell door slides and I'm hopin' that it will bind
I gotta make my move, it's the needle of death
About to shoot me in my veins till I take my last breath
Cold sweat breads bubble up, I can't stop shakin'
I gotta do something, keep thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
I'm gonna die either way, nothing to lose
I look him dead in the eye then I make my move
I kicked the guard in the sternum, not a second to wait
The strenght from my adrenaline caved his chest plate
I hit the next guard in the face with my shackles
Paint the walls dark red with blood and bone spackle
Knocked the next off the C block balcony
I snatched a tazer gun, home free I'm about to be
Made a run for the door, I didin't look back
I got shot in the back of my head and...

(What the fuck!? Did you get him?
Back up! Check his pulse!
Is he dead?
Brandy, get over here, we need some help!
What happened?
Just move!
C'mon, alright, backup!
Shit! Son of a bitch!
He just... He just jumped up!)

I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fucking pole-vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
They all trying get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand ""How to Rob"" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is, cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was, hollering, ""Fuck Compton""
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when, they were still making, Maxell casettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop

"SOCWHIU12AB01872DA","L'éducation du corps des porcs
Se fait souvent un peu à tort
Par tradition, au fond des ports
Ce sont de grands hommes gras et forts
Parlant avec l'accent du nord

Les mains lourdes comme châteaux forts
Ils s'mettent en chantant dans les forts
À malmener le corps des porcs
Parlant les mains des heures sans cesse
Ils donnent aux bêtes dans l'allégresse
Leurs désirables et nobles fesses

On y verrait de la tendresse
Dans ces pratiques un peu épaisses
Qu'appliquent ces hommes avec hardiesse
Aux désirables et nobles fesses
Si cette pratique fait leur richesse
C'est pourtant là que le bas blesse
Car le cochon hurle pour que cessent
Ces sales pratiques dont on l'agresse

Le cri du porc dans le tréport
Dresse le décor sur fond de mort

Mais cette coutume bien qu'incroyable
Dont circule entre une fable
Depuis un temps immémorial fait vivre la ville d'un art bestial

Il y avait au temps d'alors
Aux alentours du tréport
Une sombre histoire d'homme et de porc
C'était un soir de pleine lune
La mer dressée bavait l'écume

Un homme aperçu dans la brume
Sa femme dansant dans la boue brune
Elle était nue et sur la plage
Trois beaux garçons d'assez jeune âge
Dans un joyeux dévergondage se régalaient d'un tas d'outrages
La femme et eux faisent ménage
Et le mari cria de rage
Brandissant sa main en battoir
Et s'élança sûr de les voir

La lune préférant ne rien voir
S'était cachée dans la nuit noire
Et l'homme forbu de désespoir
Aveuglément criait victoire
La boue, le sang firent marécage
Et l'homme fourbu tomba en nage

C'est bien tard, au p'tit matin
Au'on découvrit au pied d'un port
L'homme piétiné, raide et bien mort
A ses côtés trois pièces d'étain à l'éffigie des trois gamins

Depuis ce temps dit on alors
En cette pratique, point de trésors
Si homme et coeur ne sont pas d'or
Proposez leur un autre sort
Vous serez déçu peut-être à tort
Car ces jeunes gens coucheraient dehors
Pour préserver ce droit du corps
Ce privilège des gens du nord

I know you said that you wanted a record you could listen to
With no cussing and shit
I tried
But I still gotta do this


Yo
Jingle jingle
We've got the lingo
With so much heat, it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter cuz I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down, do or die niggas, don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't, want your bitch
Cause sorry ass women just, don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for air now
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reefer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets


And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in ona party for sure



Alright
Somebody bring the potato salad
Let's take a ballot
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
Cuz we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing a gang of Jackie's chicken in they mouth
Anton & Sean pitching a fit
Cuz somebody rolled her bud in a henny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
500 dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
Cuz y'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that E&J and Paul Masson and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets





Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old raggedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw y'all raggedy asses' a party
And y'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out

Move!
Y'all gotta be some of the clumsiest muthafuckas

To the sounds, now it's on
Y'all done fucked up
Get out, get on
Speed up nigga
Get up, take your weed on
Yea nigga, the drunk nigga said it
Your pockets, that's where I'm heading
Kick up

A little voice way deep inside told me she was gone

Oh... This house is haunted
Oh... That's how I want it to be
Oh... This house is haunted
You can always stay here with me...

No more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days
She left and took the colours with her, buried in her grave
This is where we climbed the tower, this is where she fell
Then when her young heart stopped beating, I went to hell

Oh... This house is haunted
Oh... Ha....
Oh... This house is haunted
Ho.. . Oh...

You float through the living room, I watch my TV
I feel you sit down on the couch right here next to me
The I feel you lips touch mine just like we used to do
I'm so happy all alone being here with you...

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me


And I am whatever you say I am

I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience'
Has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media
Immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, ‘cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned


And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, ‘cause…


And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am

Mais cortante que um velho blues
Mas hoje eu só quero chorar
Como um poeta do passado
E fumar o meu cigarro
Na falta de absinto
Eu sinto tanto eu sinto muito
Eu nada sinto
Como dizia Madalena
Replicando os fariseus
Quem dá aos pobres empresta (2X)
Adeus

Her boots were brown, well should she leave town
To play the role of lover expatriate
A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior
You know she always gets one on the house
She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor
The gratuity included
You know the letter concluded
P.S. with all my love

Eyes stinging, no breath, legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women, partners in business
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors


We have 'em, depressions
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relatives past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator

They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Because god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door


And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time


These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say ""what's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
Because god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Beacuse he has no children to come back for

By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...

And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me


No I'm not worth
The salt in one tiny tear
Oh why have I brought shame
To the one I loved so dear
I'm so sorry that I hurt them
But they'll never know how sorry
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth

Strong with the desire of hate
As reality and vision united
Communion enlarge my darkness
With multitude of light
The still uncolored circle of seven senses
The visionary wheel of drifting desired shadows

Affections of remained rites
Filled by perfumes of past destination
A distant chaos far beyond
From what our eyes can see
The superhuman side within
A mixed movement of a demolished world

Unlocked narration of key elements
Creates the wall of past and future passing
Let's all wounds be now against our bodies
Release fantasy before the eyes
Runs sudden to the depth of subconscious

Decentness sun of night releases my fate
Half wayside of life and emptiness
Upland in distant night of galaxies
Glass awake the symbol of passage
Reflection demands the quest of existence

Kept upon illusions of fancy gateway
The sound of silence pours my body
Underground pyramid of blood
Creations and destructions of century bone

To deliverance
I can harness the cosmos in the palm of my hand
Bring the earth to a grinding halt by single silent command
Lay the mountains asunder, turn oceans to dry land
I've found the key that unlocks the shackles of gravity
Stones are floating overhead suspended in perfect symmetry
And the stones they sing to me...whisper soaring melodies
Accept this offering. For the past to be buried. Sustained by longing
Breathe your life into me and cure my disease
Open the window. The center of your chest
Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide
I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea
Every cut that I made, I thought of your face
And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade
But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander
In empty castles
Body is a device to calculate
Soul is the earth trodden under our feet
Mind is the beauty begging to be raped
God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate
The snake is charming us
Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines
And carry out to sea

"SOYVCJU12A67AD8617","We take sour sips from life's lush lips
And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships
Stomp out this disaster town
You'll put your eyes to the sun and say, ""I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding.""


And we might have started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon


Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh


We keep the beat with your blistered feet
And we bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
Slept through the weekend and dreaming
Of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying, ""How you been?""


We might have said goodbyes just a little soon
(Stomp out this disaster town)
Robbing lips, kissing banks under this moon


Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh


It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter


Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh

Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught then my ass is up north
Straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin back to back cigarettes
It popped off, one point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my nine up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do, run behind a tree
Fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Witness from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, K-A black, find a shorty to tag




I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause... and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin, and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for cryin, I'm a grown man strugglin
To reach the next level of life without fumblin
Down to foldin, I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
Cause niggas will have you locked up, the snitch be your man
Givin police the run down on your plans
We're never goin down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without

"SOOSLVC12A8C13E51E","Baby boy, girl - Daddy loves you with a world of strength
But my thoughts of holdin you in my arms remain at arm's length
See I was raised with romanticism, around a tradition
Which states a man should have some children with his wisdom
And your suspected mommy to be
More beautiful than any woman I could wish to see standin next to me
Intelligent, wise, beautiful eyes helps my intellect rise
Through lows and highs, makes me love bein alive
I've been dreamin 'bout your life since early teenage years
Durin a haze of beer and blunts; I envisioned you once
Immaculate black skin, me providin what you're lackin
Us coolin out, watchin flicks, laughin
Then your image disappeared, in a cloud of my fear
You're not here, but I've got some things I want you to hear
I'm scared I can't provide or survive on my own
Let alone build you a solid home where love's shown
Please allow me private moments as I gather this poem
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm on the highway in Montana and it's 7:42
And daddy wrote a rhyme just for you


If there's one thing in this life that I do hope to achieve
It's to give you all my love and make you strong before I leave
Just for you (you) just for you (you)
Just for you...


What can I say next? In '81 I wore a pair of gray specs
In '86 I started pumpin rap up in my tape deck
A younger music, then MC's would recommend
Knowledge of self, to help uplift and we'd ascend
So I send similar, messages to my listeners
Beyond perimeters, they advance to the rhythm of
A kick, snare, and hi hat; the masses won't buy that
It's drug sales and gun claps, so less loot's what I stack
I know the flow of cash ain't all that it would take
For you and I to form a bond so strong it'd never break
But I couldn't stand havin nothin in my hand in the time of your need
It's understood so shall I proceed?
Indeed there's many other factors that do come into play
That make me hesitate to bring you to this world of today
See there's a sense of desperation from miseducation
Which leaves our highest aimin far below required expectations
To play a plain hand is, the usage of language
Power's locked in codes so most misunderstand it
Major corporations plan to dwarf the layman
Our president's a profit margin; greed is growin strong and
It's just a mental death condition spawned by logo recognition
Dollar signs squalor minds, the prison's beyond our visions
I identify a piece and write it down on a page
Pray to God and hope for strength to practice healthier ways
Please pardon if I ramble through the course of this poem
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm on the highway out in Cali, it's 11:42
And daddy wrote a rhyme just for you




But you're not here because I fear what's in the future I perceive
Got me shakin so I made a little song I'm gonna leave
Just for you (you) just for you (you)
Just for you...


I had to take a long hiatus from writin this song
Thought of you while I was gone
Though my feelings vary, yes I'll carry on
Larry, Sean, Diana, Dawn; shit I'll leave it up to Mom
No idle title vital, strong; strength to help you move along
Healthy self-esteem without a selfish dream
Who got you thinkin wealth is green, I see you starin at that screen
Well it's a black hole, it's used to extract soul
Thought it was neat, kept the receipt and I'm 'bout to take it back though
My mind roams through burnin homes, worldwide war zones
Cremation of the last generation before clones
If you should run into yourself on the street
Lie then press delete, dye your hair and change your physique
Unique survival pack words, when life walks backwards
A rocky road that doesn't lack curves meant to rack nerves
True, humankind has made life a disgrace
But there's one thing that may keep you alive in this place
Love may be found if your feet are on the ground
Follow your heart but stop and start to take a look around
Swear that's all that keeps me goin, love of flowin
Love of family plus G-O-D, all seein and all knowin
Pardon if I'm psycho when I'm writin alone
May this pen commit to paper my emotions and zones
I'm in Mexico, chillin with an oceanfront view
And daddy wrote a song just for you




Baby boy, your life should fulfill your dreams
Just follow your heart and you'll get what you want every moment
Always gon' be there, there for you, you, you
Baby girl, your life should fulfill your dreams
Just do what you love and you'll love what you do every moment

I can't depend on this
Deadly hesitation
Just watching from a distance

Fear of detection
Left in overnight
A thought can quickly disappear
None left to ration
She left me for dead
Because I have interfered
Dreams of resurrection
I have wandered into the red zone
Lines quickly alter the state of physical shape
It's a thrash of more than one lifetime
But I couldn't stand to think of
A more dignified way to die
To be smiling at the end of one's life
Fragmented I'll hang
From her as a trophy
In the line of defense
I'll promptly agree
Pushing forward everyday
Trying to escape this maze
Pushing forward everyday
When will we find our way

I walked to the fertile crescent and built
The sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me

For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents

I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

I mean...I...can fly
Like a bird in the sky...

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?

Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy


Public display of affection
(Got to make them)
Pointing in my direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way


We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA, hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA hey hey
(I want your PDA)


Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument






Your PDA, hey hey
Your PDA, hey hey
(I want your PDA)


From the lobby to the patio
(Boy you're so crazy)
And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navo
(hmm, nasty)
And we're so compatible
We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly

Wake up - it's time to die
Time is running out on me like tears in the rain
Too painful to live in fear when there's no one left to blame
We're nexus six replicates, superior to man
I think therefore I am, but there's one thing I don't
Understand
Alive - why can't I be - if you could see what I've seen
I can't tell if I've been, alive, man or machine
The light that burns twice as bright, burns half half as long
The past is all we have now, we have nothing at all
The present is just a memory, that happened long ago
Like robot machines of the future
Like man old age plagues on
Alive, why can't I be, if you could see what I've seen
I can't tell if I've been, alive, man or machine
Four, five - how to stay alive
Six, seven - go to hell or go to heaven
We need more time, we need more time
Eight, nine - to the devil or divine
Ten, eleven - flesh and blood or steel and oil
We need more time, we need more time
Fiery the angels fell deep thunder
Rode around our shores
Burning with fires of all good
Forever lost in time - enhance
That's the spirit take your aim unless you're alive
You can't play the game and if you don't play
It's not the same, take it from me I'll know
We're nexus six replicates, superior to man
I think therefore I am
Why only a four year span
Made not to last
Defection!

Just a little too long a while
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I don't get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode

Sure I like country music
And I like mandolins
But right now I need a Telecaster
Through a Vibro-lux turned up to ten


Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these old country boots
For some fine Italian shoes

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We don't need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

I'm talking about Memphis
Memphis

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big old whiff

If we could just get off of that beat, little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendezvous

Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cow horns back on the Cadillac
And change the message on the code-a-phone

But ...

I'm gone
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane
With a brain
With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
Come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king

A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot
Knowledge is king

Wenn in der Nacht
Mir solch ein Mond erscheint

Chorus 1x

Die Bäume wachsen in den Mai
Wer will schon einsam sein
Doch heute in dem milden Licht
Bist du so nackt und heiß
Mund an Mund die lange Nacht
Der helle Mond zieht seinen Kreis
Auf dem Boden
Da liegt dein weissen Kleid

Chorus 2x

"SOVCOGQ12A58A7D0DE","I hear your hollow laughter
Your sighs of secret pain
Pretending and inventing
Just to hide your shame
Plastic smiles and faces
Blinkin' back the tears
Empty friends and places
All magnify your fears

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

It hurts to watch you struggle
And try so hard to win
But trade your precious birth rite
For candy coated sin
Wasting priceless moments
Restless and confused
Building up defenses
For fear that you'll be used

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

Take My yolk upon you
And walk here by My side
Let Me heal your heartaches
And dry the tears you've cried
Never will I leave you
Never turn away
Keep you through the darkness
Lead you through the day

If you're tired and weary
Weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
It feels to be alone
I will take your burden
If you'll let Me love you
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home
Wrap My arms around you
Give your heart a home

And it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! don't give up!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
Cause they don't understand!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do?
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
Pow! we're on the move! resist worldwide!
Cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure -
We're gonna take over!
Radical! terrorize! and I'm not gonna tell you lies!
Our chances are low - too many problems we got!
F**k the police! blow them out!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture! (x4)
(move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x 3)

Move! I shout it out loud!
We're radical and we're proud of it...

Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game
And I sing the song of freedom to hate!
Try to think international!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy!
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x3)
Destroy 200 years of culture! (x3)
(move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x2)
Destroy 2000 years

Your freedom to speak is a freedom to lie
Whatever it takes to change .. I'm up for it!
There's no place where noone gets hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head...
They always try and get you back to what they define as reality!
There's nothing to lose but watch your back!
It's cold out here... (don't wait too long!)

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x6)
(move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x4)
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!

Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted

And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer

I've been torn down enough to know
Everyone goes through this door
Just before their lives explode
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind
But you can feel it its a gentle love
Coming out soft from the windows above
Just when you have had enough
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I look across at the sons and daughters

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon
You can't do much about the trouble life brings
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring
But stay here once from spring to spring
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands
You can push me I don't mind
Leave me out here and I'll be fine
Cause everyone's gonna have their time
Up or down honey you decide

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water

Yo! They love the way I pin a champ
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp
I kill the reciters of lies
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays
A sideways death for a narrow grave
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy!

Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched
Lock and load up, post up, toast up


Hey yo, my vocal duel, payments hiatus save the local crews
Only the chosen few can ride with the most explosive crew
But not you, jealous ones they envy us
Cause we spit venomous, until books remember us
Hell fire embedded in us, plus sins condemning us
It's just what I write, ignite cop killers and predators
I be like this, best believe I can't be ignored
Spitting metaphoric, until the chosen child is aborted
When my mind's in orbit, forces knock you out your high horses
Deal with high sources, until the meal is five courses
The flames is high, when my brain and the train collide
Under much needed change in time, the game is mine
I build strength through the niggas that be hating me peers
But it's the army, part of me ya'll been waiting for years
From a small block, hip hop, busting my tool
King Syze, dope shit, what can I say, man, it's nothing new

 x2


I'm a scientist in the lab, with a violent twist and a gift of gab
Pharaoh tongue that can lash through your clique and stab
From the days where you carried screw drivers
In back pockets in case you had to prove that your crew lava
We was painting on your property
And until this day I still got rookie niggas out trying to copy me
Planetary nigga, Q-D original
Smooth criminal, bash your mental, bruise your physical
There's something about the evilness of this track
It makes the heaven's gates close, and the tabernacles crack
In fact, it separates all the lies and the facts
It makes you see the light right before the sky turns black
It turns boys to men, it turns toy soldiers to generals
Innocent motherfuckers graduate to criminals
It makes you think twice about who you are
It makes you feel like death coming every sixteen bars

Where did the night go to?
Strange how it slips away when I'm with you

I know it's almost two
I know you should leave, but wait
I've thought it over
And there's something I gotta say

Why don't you spend the night?
Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon?
Please stay 'til the morning light

It's such a long way home
And you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now
Why don't you spend the night?

Maybe I spoke too soon
And maybe my timing's wrong
Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all

But when I look in your eyes
I feel like we're almost one
Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun

Why don't you spend the night?

I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin out ""The Roots"" while I balance wit the wire
Yo, expert in this profession, the session
In 1987, I linked up wit the ?uestion
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
Swollen wit minds that got stolen
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin they grown, tellin they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin in the last times left
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, LET'S SPARK THIS!!
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin it)
We are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin it)

You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms ?I wire?
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir
We ex-plore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said ""Let him go""
I woke, during a center to London-Heathrow
And now wit a past, fuckin wit border patrol
I'm findin it out, I'm leakin wit my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education
]From Illa-Fifth to Switzerland destination
The Roots du journ, go check the translation
The dictionary of devout topics, far from ebonics
The Fifth Dynast, they can't stop it
Yo Zurlich y'all keep it tight heed
While The Roots Crew smoke weed
Yo, we are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin it)
We are the ULTIMATE, say what? (rock-rockin it)

A veces resulta y muchas otras veces no
Nos hicimos tantas cosas sucias sin razón
Y fue inevitable, nos rompimos el corazón

Pero la mañana llega igual
La gente arranca temprano
Algunos mas otros menos
Es la ley de la vida, no se puede parar

Todos fuimos puestos en la ruta del dolor
Bicho que camina va a parar al asador
Fuimos dos extraños así fue como empezó
Dimos tantas vueltas y al final no se quien sos

Vamos a meternos en el mar
La luna pega en el agua, hace calor en la playa
Vas surfeando las olas que el destino te da

Y aunque hoy perdimos la señal
Así es la ley de la vida, es una ruleta rusa
Hecha de cal y de arena, de principio y final
Cada día mas confusión, una escandalosa prisión
Una jungla sin compasión, hecha de misterio y traición

Nos clavamos los puñales nena, por detrás
Dejalo que sangre! Lo mejor es olvidar
Sacate la careta baby, ya no actuemos más
Lo que cura enserio las heridas es amar y cantar

Esta es la tierra del oro y el sol
Sangre, camino, desierto y calor
Entre tu karma y la ley del talión
Asi es la ley de la vida mi amor

Ya se que no soy Tiberio gemelo ni vos Calígula
Pero no te paso a buscar nunca más con un Cadillac
Ni los sueños nena, fuimos casi hermanos
Después pasaron mas de dos mil años
Y hoy otra vez estamos en aquel mismo lugar

But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know? The Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there
(Yeah!) Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

Real live y'all (Live y'all!)

Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario?


(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (later!) later, alligator
Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O
Incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)


It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did


I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear


You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario


Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine!
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging in the mind library
Oh-my-gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Roar, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Ripping up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!


Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Baby it is all I need, it is all I need


Since the day I have been loving you
I cannot catch a cold, I cannot catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need


Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need
Just a little bit baby

Bring your love and nothing else

You are a fingernail running
Down the chalkboard I thought I left in third grade
Now my only consolation
Is that this could not last forever
Even though you're singing and thinking how well you've got it made


Who are you?
When will you be through
Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase

Call it women's intuition

Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
But sooner than later they'll be throwing quarters at you on the stage

That I don't have much anymore
It said ""I don't want fortune
I don't want fame
I only want the treasure

Look me in the eye
Tell me if you see
Traces of yourself
Growing here in me
Tell me if you find
Your heart in mine
I pray you'll see your light
When you look me in the eye

Since I wrote that page
And somehow with the passing time
I've let that truth slip away

Each and every day that your
Holiness, your Godliness
Is all that will remain

Center my soul

Because everyone has figured you out...

So think before you open your mouth...

So sit back and relax, chew up the scenery

Let the people see what you wanted them to believe

Because I don't care if you sink or if your ship wrecks

I will only assume it was because of me...

To make you fall

Then you can phone the doctor and tell him what a mess I've been....

A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka
He was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessy
Makin' enemies fast
In L.A. and they didn't play
He got into a tangle with Ray, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daiquiri
Johnnie politely walked her ass behind the factory
Now, all four uncles E&J wanna talk, see
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggas off me
He got Jacked for his Daynas, in other words
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted a Thunderbird
With the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
'Cause he caught him lickin' Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remy spent his last buck up
Remy caught him shootin' game at Elayne, so now
Flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remy ended up runnin' off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin' fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
With a .38 straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
Spilled him and Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin' Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin'
Down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartles and Jaymes, cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach on the rocks

Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit or come to grips

I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles…


In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to

Just to see what we find

They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful

Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation, like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man-servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles…


In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me
""Keep making that face it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk *like this*
'Til I stuck my tongue
On that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet…


In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you


Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
And I'm reaching out for you


To my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes that fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs


Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance

Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh

There's something in my neighborhood
It's getting stronger every day
There's a rumor that lights up all of me
And it whispers from the rooftops up above
I must hold on or I'll fly away

Oh, no, not the autumn leaves
Lift you up like a flower in the cool night breeze
My heart's just flying when he walks by

Oh, but he's my inspiration
Yes indeed my pride and joy
Don't you say nothing bad about
What's between me and my baby boy

My mom has her point of view
""You'll learn the hard way
If that's what you're gonna do""
My sister don't have much to say
My girlfriend told me when I was young
You'll know him the minute that he's there
Oh can't you feel it coming in the air?

Oh no, not a summer song
Makes the night feel better
When the day goes wrong
My heart's just a singer when he walks by

Oh no, not a summer night
You forget about tomorrow
Cause the world seems right
There goes my baby walking by

Oh, but he's my inspiration
Yes indeed my pride and joy
Don't say nothing bad about

I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard
It all falls apart at first touch


Watching the reel as it comes to a close
Brutally taking it's time
People who change for no reason at all
It's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events?
Disturbing and purging my mind
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done
I know that I'll lose every time


Moving along in our God given ways
Safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles
Left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give?
Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more
And watch as they drop by the beach

Destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives

And you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock
That too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my God I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled
Heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl

There ain't a woman finer

Than the one in Carolina

At the top of Black Mountain Road

Friday comes around

I'll pour some coffee down

And buddy I'll be good to go

Now three hundred four

And a half miles one way

Puts me on her front pourch steps

I know what I got comin'

The kissin' and a huggin'

About as good as any man can get

For two days and two nights

Everthing's alright

Happy as a hardwood tree

The only thing wrong

When Sunday comes along

I've got to rocket back to Tennessee

After last chorus:
Just can't let her down

She's the best girl I have found

I make that Ashville turnaround

I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question ""Should we take that bullshit from them people?""
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future

Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block

Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?




Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga




Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...

And disposable by design

In the crown of the conqueror worm
And as time pens down we'll say that we'll always feel this way

Shock to the heart and away we go
And if you wake up in the morning and it still feels wrong
Then put your money in the sad machines
For bombs, punks and tiger teams

Wear heavy metal pants for the labelin' head
Who can blame it on the band who killed themselves next door
For just another little chance to love a lie
I say they loved a lie
And we will kick them straight down the line
With a conscience clear of mind

Y'all judges some weak pussies, y'all preaches some rapin' fags
These people that made us slaves, these niggas wavin' they flags
America ain't shit but home of the hot lick
They hang us all by rope, then laugh and cut off our dick

I cry from heaven above
This time can only be kept...
By those who never have wept
It's strange these things that we're told
Live fast and never grow old
Live fast and die in your shoes
The devil, the devil, may choose

Heeee, liii Heee, liii

Keep up with wishes of sin
Your life will never begin
Cleanse now the scum in your soul
Out the lies, the lies you've been told
These things can always be found...
Ind arkness, always in doubt
Look up, don't age with content
Get strong and go deep within

Heee, liii. Heee, liii

You say, you're falling in love
Cry for shelter from heaven above
Release the sin that lives in your heart
Let the devil cry out in the dark
Lifestyle is taking its toll
Let yourself go just lose all control
Just 'cause you know you are bored
Don't you fall down upon your own sword

As the waves rolled o'er the decks and snatched away
To fading memory

As summer gave it's life away to autumn
A promise made fulfilled on his return
A six month job with a privateer
Knowing it'll make him rich to give
All that she deserves

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love and now
She's alone with her tears

The winter slowly passed away to spring
She spends her days out waiting on the pier
Spring turned into summer
And she realized he wasn't coming home
On a warm summer's day she went alone
Blinded by her grief she said goodbye to the sun
Up upon the widow's walk they saw her fall into the bay
A fading memory

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love
But now there's no more tears
She brought herself back to his arms
Within a watery grave
And now they spend eternity together
Lost within the waves

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone
But you can't let it keep you weighted down

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be
It's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Living can be a fight
Sometimes you find yourself wandering down
To the cold winter streets in your life

When you're a prisoner of the time
And the darkness is closing in
With all your heart you've got to rely
On the song that is hidden within
The song that cries out to begin

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive

Like a cool wind that flows
From a valley unseen
Out of the depths of a trembling heart
You find yourself starting to sing

Listen to your own words
It's the power of what you believe
Let the chorus build louder and louder
And shatter the blackness and pain
Let it rise like a healing flame

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive

Can't lock up the truth
Or chain our beliefs
Can't drown out the song
Of those who are free!

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive

"SOITKDW12A8C13BA44","I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills
Then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers with skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap That sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy ""Yo man, you hear what he said?""
Another funky rhythm
Look at your man and give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it
I go to work


I go to work
I go to work


I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation, I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with  endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait; it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work


I go to work
I go to work


I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme rocks ya
Some times it knocks ya  so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Writing my rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow, you blow
You know you go, I flow
I throw all pro, I go to work




To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work

Qui s'envola et que Dieu le damne
Revint sur moi se soulager

And nowhere is near

With their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure
In the corner over here
With an empty apartment
And a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles
And he tells me how well he's walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

La fuerza necesaria para arder

Va silvandome despacio

For my peeps in the streets, the beef don't cease

Doing dirt in the grinds now

Certain to shine, the streets had a perfect desire
And I believe it's what it made me to be
Revolutionary slave to my hated beliefs
I was raised in the street, got hate for police
Born in the ghetto, crack stay peddled on concrete
Where the bullshit's abbreviated, move and you lose
And your crew gets eliminated, it's complicated
To the death and 
Keep your eyes open for the devils and demons

Travel through your tweeters to the ghetto I might teach you
Credible believer until it's settled I might see you
Better make em flee ah, better make em bleed what
Begging for a piece of pie in the grind
I keep  factory line
This is for my people living in hard times




Street dreams, in
The slum where the beast feeds
Where the struggle resides where hustlers and fiends meet
Just trying to get by, burning on green leafs
I gotta get mine, no one else gonna feed me
Survival etched in the genes of my species
Stand on my own two, no one said it'd be easy
Just keep it moving, feet where the streets be
Better be easy, put your teeth to the streets, b
Cannibal tooth die for the loot
Wild animal escaped from the zoo
They call me elephant boots out on the loose
No surrender or truce
Torture what the New World Order lies in the news
Propaganda catching minds in a snooze

Too many sips of the brew, sick spit off the booze
So hold up man, watch how you move




I done see it all, a
Legend in my own right
You fight for the right of respect when you step in my light
Always stay ducking the devils to the death to the birth
We destined to burst from underground soul in the dirt
Straight to the top we headed leaving devils beheaded
On the world that's filled with controversy, thoughts are embedded
Of violent action, racism, you see it on the news
And listen brainwashing the masses through subliminal television

They don't help me the slightest bit when I need it
So fuck em, I live my own life, I blaze my own trail
Do a little dirt, get locked up, I pay my own bail

Dodging pitchforks, at war on the darkest levels

They ask how I knock my stuff off
I tell 'em niggas everyday I'm hustlin
Like a I'm a young Ross
Never been tough you was cut from one cloth
It must have been velvet cause you dumb soft
Can't squash beef once a nigga get bumped off
You're sweeter than duck sauce
I couldn't give a fuck if you lost love
Once a couple shots get bust off
We lost blood and you said it ain't no love lust
Your man said it's dead so you taking your gloves off

You not strapped but you claim you're holding
So when shit pop off you be laying frozen
Then you wanna claim everything that's rolley
Living off my fame so your fame is stolen
You playing kid games and in game we growing
Put shame in the game so the game exposed her
The things that you claim it's insane I told her
So shut your kid playing man this things is chosen
You hate what you ain't controlling
You a scumbag, your mother should've named you Trojan
I got my weight up they was talking Unity I
But when they had me running star they had me ruger me stop
Perpetuating frauds claiming that we poo when we not
Like I ain't hear your stories when you got your jewelry pop
They call you by your first name you cool with these cops
You never feel the high one, but you soon to be shot
Since I was 16 man I used to shoot on these blocks
Duba duba we had the whole community locked
So when I started buzzing they already knew we was hot
Open them doors and the opportunity knock
I show my son the knowledge so he understand daddy
I teach my girl the wisdom so she make her man happy
My baby girl got my eyes she be starring at me
I let her know I'm too young to be a gran daddy
Man my wisdom is strong I could lift a carone
Quick as the glitch of a star drift as the ways of a lock
As I sit with the gods I see you sit with the frauds
Scripture my songs to show how dangerous these instruments are
You can hit with the drums, man a rhythm is hard
The high hemic you high flesh you can hear the guitars
My brain cells is jail ink pen is the yard
Such a prison with bars I got some visits to mom
You brag about getting head from a chick ass minor
You don't brag about ruining that vagina diner
Lyrically inclined, spiritually divine
Mentally designed to leave you blind
It was meant for me to rise balistikally I grind
Third eye, trilogy the eyes epidemy wise
All you women beating guys is quick to meet demise
Could meet the mister meet the crimes
Just to see you dine
I'm pulling mm's 9's physically I'm fine
I got my weight up in that chimp you niggas seeing size
Throw nigga be inside to pick the bee behind
I'm seriously surprised you killing me you guys
Try dissing me at times but victory was mine
Backstabbing motherfuckers sticking me with knives
All your trickery and lies with misery combined

For I am the Man with the Dogs

I stare at you shopping
Watch while you're walking
Two dogs run around your toes

You turn around
Two eyes break you down
""Now, who does that guy think he's starin' at?""

Stop in your tracks
You're being laughed at
You armored ego is nude

And I do and I do
Crack up 'cos I'm getting to you
I see you I see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

Down to your church
I'm looking for victims
Spell of the Man with the Dogs

I'll haunt you
And follow you to work
That ghost is back again

Creep into you
I won't go away
You're taking yourself too seriously

I smile as you frown
And turn to walk away
Your habits for all to see

I see a shrew
I see you
And the rodent things you do
You see you I see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah and I'm gonna laugh
Open wide

Saw you again
You'll see me tomorrow
Curse of the Man with the Dogs

You may not like me
You won't forget me
Not safe even in Walgreen's

They've seen me
Ask your friends
'Oh I know him'
Seen but I'm never heard
By your lot

A stare
Is worth a thousand biting phrases
See how stupid you are?

I dare you I dare you
To erase my laser tattoo
You see you you see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah, and I'm gonna laugh

Is it pubic hair
Is it cobweb air

I lost a lot when you fell, life is hard to bluff
You think its hell where you at
Shit its hell on the streets
You maintaining in the Bing, I'm surviving to eat
Don't think am wilding, flexing whips and stuff
Thinking I'm lost laying down
Sex for trips and stuff
I'll admit it I'm use to the finer things
We had major names even on the minor things
Everywhere we went, mad bitches sizing me up
You know they tight now, shit I get to drive the trucks
But I wish you were spreading it riding it rough
I think I miss that more then you buying me stuff
Since you got knocked your man tried to hollar at me
And those nigga's you stuck, they throwing dollars at me
But you know this gaming, and Im just keeping it real
Holding you down until you back on the field


Feels like I do
I feel when feeling down
In the ground feeling down
It can be most anyday


Don't worry 'bout these streets I'm conrolling these grounds
I might slip and miss a V-I but I'm holding it down
Got the kids to take care its hard out here
And its tearing my heart to play my part out here
I seen that snitch and you know I got plots 4 years
And your bid make me feel like I got the chair
But ain't nobody tapping this I rather tap my own
Watching tapes we made while I'm resting alone
Wishing you home, pictures of you flipping the chrome
What kind of chic will leave her man when he out the zone
Me without you is like a stickman without a silencer
Got me X-ing off days on the calendar
I miss loading the Glock so you could control the block
I miss watching you work the dogs to tighten the lock
Think of the time boo pushing it like a 6 double o
You get your weight up I'm a drain you once they let go

Chorus


I can see us back on the bricks, me on your shoulder
Letting bitches know they wishes to have you are over
So you ring your broads while you locked away
I know its hard for a nigga on top not to play
See Amil's the one you kept draped in ice
I'm the one waiting silk down caked in spice
Waiting for your calls or my box to vibrate
Hoping you want me to come scoop you not being more weight
I fell from Gucci sandals back to no name brands
From a six and a mansion to beating the sands
Staying true make ends meet to have enough for the love I take
All-savage and stuff
Have a brick where most F.E.D.S. dare to touch
Fear none to see the cash, and us popping the clutch
Chopping a Dutch-flip cop twice as much living low key
A minute then heist and stuff
If I have to wait while you gone I'm a take what comes
If you don't see cash, know its hard in the slums
Cause I ran through the stash and it ain't no funds

Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave
Be sure you find
You want her love much more than mine
Then I'll just say we've never met

Funky fuckers

Erick Sermon:
Y'alll guess what the fuck is going on now
Me and Reggie Noble, making funk tunes around the global
Cause times keeps on slippin', and I get the funk from the kitchen
Then commits to ass whippin', there is no time for me to bust it
So I'm a chill and let Red get into a fly poetic justice

Redman:
Yo, it's all in the mind and I'm high and I kick it for the do or die
On 2 or 1 area code, leavin' shit blown
Funkadelic is the one to bring the creature out your preacher
And I make girls act like they can't find they shoes when I freak 'em
Oooh, yes y'all I got the mad method can you catch it?
And if your ear's not tuned in then adjust it

Erick Sermon:
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9 representin' today
Hey, Erick Sermon's on the way
Dre gave me a ride so I Gangsta Lean while DRS will put the smoke in my chest
And if you understand me then escape and kick it
While the E-Double gets wicked with your brain twisted
It's going down, it's going way down
Go get the 4 pound and boogie down

Redman:
Boogie boogie to boogie to bang, boogie to that
My rap get mad dap on ass cracks in effort if it's BMI or ASCAP
Cause my funk rolls thicker than Bisquick
If it's mixed with that same funky sticky stuff I roll my spliffs with
I shot the sheriff on the terrace
And I kick the funk like these to have more off days than Ferris
Just wrote these raps up in the studio
Brothers can't tell and sisters can't hear me though (hear me ho)

Hook:
E got the funk, Red got the funk, Red got the funk, E got the funk (x2)

Erick Sermon:
Someones knockin' at my door, yo Johnny Gill, I need the whole floor
So I can get busy remember? And if you don't call Michael Jackson
And don' be afraid to ask him, Erick Sermon got mad tunes
No matter what they say, I got more props than Richard Bay
The mind bogglin' with the hardcore followin'
So what's up, cause I don't give a fuck

Redman:
Whoa, I make you sing with Toni Braxton
I tear the shreds out of jams in stadiums when it's packed in
Back up boy you messing with the rudeboy yes I told ya
I rock leather jacks with Timbs, sweatpants; one leg rolled up
Hold up! This is a stick up, I spark the izm
The 'boom-kick' like a Biz cut, one twos and skirts'll lift up
E got the funk and Red got the funk, pop the trunk
I got blocks of funk to make a victim say ""That's the one!""
Of course, I'm funky like fat people having intercourse
Basically the funk's stuck in your teeth so get your dental floss
Oh oh, freak out, 20 & over let me knock your teeth out
When I was young I made my tree house to a weed house
And I'm deeper than Nostradamus, swimming in chronic
And I leave your kitty cats meow in home made bondage (meow)

Keiner ist mir vorgesetzt

Meine Ma' stirbt fast vor lauter Angst um mich
Weil ich keine Sicherheiten hab, auf lange Sicht!
Ich bin angepisst, keiner will noch zu mir stehen

At least you can predict this every year

Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see something about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give





How can I love you 

If you just don't talk to me, babe


It flows through my head
The question is she needed
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this

No worries in my head
I used to flap my arms

Just like a superbird
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Up and down the chandelier
All around the room

They said that little boys
Ain't supposed to lie
Poor little superbird
Sitting on the ground
No zoom, zoom, zoom
When anyone's around

Fly, fly, fly, Superbird

To wreck your dreams
Have your fun

They said I couldn't
So what did I do then?
I cried myself to sleep
And never tried again
Poor little Superbird
They woke you up too soon
No Santa Clause
Or green cheese on the moon

It skipped my mind for years
At least until tonight
When I tucked the kids in
And I turned out the light
There at the doorway
You'll never guess what I heard

Paranoia builds this foundation of life
Forever 'til a change of times

They've killed the devil with undying affection
As he spoke with peaceful phrases before his dying breath
An unattained peace within his self before this death
For a handful of misbelievers of a no man's faith
When good made evil

Alarms triggering, in the back of your mind
Cracks streamline the walls of an empty skull
Prying into the sky

Behold, a circumstance untold of misconceptions
That lead to contradictions
Hi-fidelity of wrong proportions
That spiral into white noise

All obedience disruled...through a visual trap
Cast your stones...closet of skeletons
One to many broken bones

Hiding lies
A costly fear
Question all
Question its reason

An ecstasy you didn't reach...now empty for you

This glimpse of terror
A sight so unsound
An ecstasy you didn't reach

A blind mirror...no reflection...the real world

The furthest one has been
All this time is wasted
Standing on these actions
A quick jolt to reality

These mind terrorist invading a black sand beach
Extinguish a scene of this unleveled conflict
This lapse in time
Turn the page of life
This blame for pain
Been left behind

You acted like things never happen
A stab with simple little phrases
This action of serpent words
It's now your fear they're tasting

Wenn ich ruhig bin
Und gleichzeitig nach vorn und hinten schau
Wenn ich schwebe
Weil ich alles verzeihen kann
Und plötzlich die welt versteh
Wenn ich wirklich lebe
Und mich selbst von oben seh


Dann ist lachen
Lachen wie weinen
Und weinen
Weinen wie lachen


Wenn ich stark bin
Und menschen um mich sind dabei
Wenn ich mutig bin
Und mich einfach über nichts besonderes freu
Wenn ich springe
Weil die nächte so schön sind
Und die tage gar nicht schwer
Immer wenn ich singe
Und mich selbst von innen hör

Real madness, real savages still get to clappin
You feel me captain? Dope boys dealin packages
Stick-up kids practicin, the wait for taxi kids
Where everything is planned out - there's no accidents
Drunk drivers crashin whips, livin life hazardous
And nothin surprises me any more
Young killers strapped up ready for war, you ready it's on
You read for Born? Ask yourself that
The realest in rap, some cats fearin the track
Look they shook, know I'm a crook, be stealin the cash
Full moon, Snowgoon, gutter bar wolfpack
No time to look back, look Jack, the kid never took crap
Catchin jookz fast, yo Rock where the hooks at
Tell 'em why we crooked cats, okay 10 entertainment
Rap on smash get tooken back fast


Welcome to the real world, this ain't no MTV
This is my lifetime, spill it on a MP3
Empty 3, leave you on bended knee
Pretend-to-be MC's, you gon' feel the heat


And PERSONALLY~! I know you faggots wanna murder me
I feel the urgency, tryin to put me under surgery
State of emergency, for the record, y'all don't worry me
Curse God - tell that Devil to come and bury me
Lost one of my mans last week so lately
I've been ridin around in black Jeeps, ready to blast heat
Cut up your body, throw the parts on a trash heap
And laugh about it over hashish, I'm so trashy
You wanna know what Born life about? Come ask me
Show you firsthand, teach you how to clap heat
Shit - maybe I should write me a book
Title the joint ""Born in Each Year: The Life of a Crook""
Don't get it twisted dawg; I ain't as nice as I look
Hand skills like {?}, nice with the hooks
Fill the Dutch when forms meditate, get my think on
This winter the don's back, catch me with the mink on

Aching to swim that river of desire
Leaving innocence there on the bank by their clothes
A man holding on to a woman letting go


There's a man with a bottle on the other side of town
Swimming with a memory that he can't drown
Lord, it ain't sunk in that she ain't coming home
Oh, a man holding on to a woman letting go


His heart is telling him to hang on for dear life
Cause deep down he knows she's letting go for good this time


There's a daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
Fighting back tears and forcing a smile
Oh, For 22 years he's watched her grow
A man holding on to a woman letting go
In the Hill Valley Home there's a feeble old man
And he's holding on to a fragile old hand
And the angels are coming to carry her home
Now he's a man holding on to a woman letting go






A man holding on to a woman, a woman letting go

It was an epidemic, it floated through the air


The doctors they got troubled and they didn't know what to do
They gathered themselves together, they called it the Spanishin flu


Soldiers died on the battlefield, died in the counts too
Captain said to the lieutenant, ""I don't know what to do.""

To turn away from evil and seek the Lord and pray

Bothing ever touched my soul like this before
Feels so right
Feels so right


Now if I told you that you're worth the world and all it's love to me
If I told you that I wanna birth a family with you some day
If I told you that I wanna grow old together what would you say?
If I was to let you know I wanna see forever with you
Would you run away?



If I told you I wanna be your drive
Your strength and courage when your weak
I send my angels out every night to protect you from the street
If you knew I'd sacrafice almost everything to keep you happy
Would you let me love you for life
It's all I want It's all I need

Ad-lib your memories by casting a drought


You take the veil
You take the dive
You take the veil


A mass of gallon sloth
As flys have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim
Someone said but who is to know
And when you find the fringe
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary
Spilling by the day


Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again

Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again

Virulent hives
Of bedpost piles
Virulent
Virulent hives


Who brought me here?
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear
Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here?

In the desk where next to your chair's the handle to your door
Dismantle the door handle, put the parts into your desk drawer
Say some words then make a sign, now open up the drawer:
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you object to objects actually meaning more
Than some pathetic, lame aesthetic stolling rone is famous for
Push the drawer closed, grab a firehose, point it at the door
Get it all wet, remember, forget what rock & roll is for
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you're fishing for a mission way beyond the door
First you dream, next you're scheming, searching through your drawer
For an oar for your trip bound for yet uncharted shores
Over-reaching, find me spieling, cataloging doors
The door's a symbol for
These objects in your drawer

You begin to see the value of your freedom
The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer boys
Crying out, mommy won't come out of the bathroom
And you'd hoped he'd say he's sorry if he hit you
But he's buried in the screenplay of his feature
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Straight from a film I forget who was in
Screen kiss, one screen kiss
Blue filter lens, in a pool of Vaseline
But all the rushes look the same
Only there's a movie I wouldn't pay to see again
If it's the one with him in

You and I could be a mile above the earth tremors
Hold to me and we'll climb
You could sneak out while he's sleeping

Change the world overnight

Any more than the discovery of radium

Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James,like it happened to me

Gettin' paid , usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back

Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage

Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me

Vernacular's pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure

Run around town sayin' he is the best

Hit'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pay the bill, and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee,""
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat

Durch die Wälder Asgards, Gullveig rief man sie
Als sie vor den Toren Valhalls Einlass begehrte
Öffneten die Asen ihr, voller Sympathie
Gullveigs lächeln hatte Macht ihr Plan war ein gemeiner
Mit der Kraft der Schönheit hat sie Odins Volk getrügt

Einmal in der Feste luden Odin und die andren
Gullveig ein zutrinken, sie nahm an
Als das Fest gefeiert wurde fing sie an zu reden
Über Gold und Geld und was man damit alles kann
Viele Asen hörten zu und fingen an zu schmachten
Wollten Reichtum, stritten dann und schlugen aufeinander ein

Als der Streit am ärgsten war, die Asen sich bekriegten
Blickte Vater Odin, Gullveig ins Gesicht
Er sah wie sie lachte, wie sie dieser Groll erfreute
Dass dort Schwerter kreisten, darum scherte sie sich nicht
""Brüder"", rief er ""haltet ein! Das Weib will uns vernichten
Zwietracht ist der Hexensaat, es keimt in ihrem Blut!""

Kaum gesprochen endete der Kampf der Asenmeute
Alle blickten jählings auf die Hexe voller Hass
Gullveig fühlte Augenblicklich, dass die List nicht glückte
Sie fing an zu zittern, wurde plötzlich leichenblass
Odin schrie: ""Dein falsches spiel soll deinen Tod besiegeln
Brennen sollst du Hexenweib, dein Ende sei gewiss!""

Augenblicklich stürzten sich die Asen auf die Hexe
Banden sie und schlugen ihr die Fäuste in den Leib
Odin sprach: ""Der Scheiterhaufen soll dein Ende bringen
Niemand stört der Asenruhe UND NUN BRENNE WEIB!""
Kaum gesprochen ward es wahr, die Hexe stand in Flammen
Als das Feuer ausgebrannt war, lachte Gullveig laut

""Niemand ist imstande, mir mein Leben zu entreißen""
Sprach die Riesin, doch die Asen taten es erneut
Weitere zwei Male wollten sie das Weib entzünden
Doch die Hexe starb nicht und das hat sie nicht erfreut
Gullveig floh nach Osten, um den Asen zu entrinnen
Odin und die seinen blieben Ahnungslos zurück

Verse One: Parrish Smith

I was coolin in my car one day you see
Clockin a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin, the fingers start to snappin
E now was coolin, Brooklyn spirits we was snappin
Comin in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
A meeting at twelve, and the car overheated
Feelin real low, low enough to die
Holdin up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And alls we kept sayin was please listen to my demo (listen to my demo)

Please listen to my demo (3X)
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

Verse Two: Erick Sermon

In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
Then I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin
Thinkin if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin, and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played ?if it was sock? innocent from backstabs
People start to smile inside we buckwhylin
Sayin this all started back from freestylin
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo G, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was luvy duvy
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos

Thus they proclaimed any given truth
And swallowed
As if to justify their fear

He knew that there had been hordes of seers
Before him
Who set out to cure
Though, the sick wished not to part with
Their decease
As if it made them feel
Alive

In the wordless chamber
He accepted desperation
And the unpredictable manifestations
Of hope

El salon en la penumbra

Que ya he vuelto, que si que si que si

Que a tu lado lo rizo, a tu lado la crema
A tu lado lo subo, lo elevo, lo asciendo
Lo vuelo y lo planeo
Peinando las nubes (si) pintando el cielo
Hecho lo hecho y dicho lo dicho
Preparare la cena, porque estaba escrito

"SOSBXRW12AB01857E0","When I was a lad and Old Shep was a pup
O'er hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eyesight was fast growin' dim
Then one day, the doctor looked at me and said
""I can't do no more for him, Jim""

With a hand that was tremblin', I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run
And I wished that they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knee
I stroked the best pal that a man ever found
I cried, so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie, he knew he was goin' to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
""We're parting, but you understand""

Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with Old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home

Going back and forth and forth and back

When the world is crumblin' down 'round you and me

It's the promise that keeps you warm

Comerte A Besos
Ah caray!

Tanto tuve que esperar por ti
Ya he perdido la nocion del tiempo
Pero conquistarte fue mi fin
Y hoy se hizo realidad mi sueño
Era inevitable, que esto iba pasar
Tu ya vas cediendo, y yo quiero mas

Coro:
Te voy a comer, a besos
Te voy a llegar muy dentro
Hoy te voy amar muy lento
Vivire las fantasias
Que soñaba noche y dia con tu cuerpo

Ahora puedo comprender, por que
Mi actitud no te inspiro confianza
Porque alguien te mintio, fue infiel
Pero yo vine a curar, tu alma
Era inevitable, que esto iba a pasar
Tu ya vas cediendo, y yo quiero mas

(Coro)
Te voy a comer, QUE?, a besos, besos
Te voy a comer, UY!, a besos, besos
Comerte a besos, llegar muy dentro

Dame tan solo un momento
Tu, tu, tu, sabes lo que quiero
Te voy a comer, QUE?, a besos, besos
Te voy a comer, te voy a comer a besos, a besos, te voy a comer

De los pies a la cabeza, hasta que amenezca
Te voy a comer, EH?, a besos, besos
La boca, los labios, todita, te voy a comer mujer
Te voy a comer, AH CARAY!, a besos, a besos, comerte a besos

Poco a poco despacito
Voy amarte suavecito
Asi como te lo digo hoy
Te como ese cuellito (comerte a besos)

For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known
I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could
Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

In old Mexico, they call him the Rhumba King
Leads all the women around on a string
When they go out, they get a million thrills
But the lovely senoritas wind up with the bills

Always on the go
Sun shinin' down on Mexican Joe

He makes the night spots all along the bay
People want to see him when he comes their way
He spreads so much joy everywhere he goes
Everyone shouts ""Viva la Mexican Joe.""
He likes to gamble, at poker he's an ace
He's always lucky with the cards that got a face
At winning the money, he is sure a whiz
But when they win they don't collect
'cause they don't know where he is

He don't no income tax 'cause he don't got no dough
Still he gets along just fine, how we'll never know
He's got everything he wants, a girl, a drink, a song
If we use his formula, we surely can't go wrong
His favorite playground is anywhere there's girls
He's got that somethin' that sets their hearts a-whirl
It couldn't be his money 'cause he ain't got a peso

You must have imagined it, you just never had it

You talk about it
Like you were there
It's all heresay
No one cares- No one hears you!

Honor you hold none you're not worthy
Pride you can't buy, you have to earn it
The stories you tell have no credibility
All your name dropping's gonna get your ass beat
Say what you will
No one hears you

It's all bullshit
No one cares- No one hears you
Shut the fuck up!

I said ""Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick""

I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD

I waited for my grandad, ""So daddy can I get a puff?""
He looked at me, he says ""Son, man, you're too young kid""
""When you get older now and you understand that""
""I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary""

No I cannot believe it's you, really you

They don't seem to realize
They're listening but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
Because I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine


Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you


Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
Because nothing can change all the things that you've done to me
Nothing can make me stay
Oh, Because you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you


I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know


Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Bygone, remote, and cast aside?
Did you hold it in your hands every single night?
Did you wash them in the waters of a grave?

Silence in sovereign fleet the hand that dare seize the fire
Struggle to sound above the piercing
Echo trill of this hapless, bloody sigh
Stalking in this fearful symmetry the trail back
To the hammer, the chain, and the furnace

Slowly they will tarnish and break
The tiger utters not his own name
And in triumph, and in glory
Our earth is blackened
In solace do we sing

I'm not ashamed
If blood is what you ask
Then I have nothing to offer

Your ghost is leaving; it has undone itself
In death they do speak low into our ears

A nations ripped through ?
Forcefield shields to protect the innocent from phony militant

Preach on Africa, if they kill Mumia watch the struggle turn to massacre
While you getting prostitutes and drinking wine up in the Sheraton
I just came from a sweat lodge with twelve Native Americans

Treat them like the enemy humanity will need them

Mislead them

That he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And being that, he was a pitcher here in the winter air (What happened)
They set it up to get him there and hit him there (Damn)

So before they got to, load and spark
He said, hold up, my heart (Hold up hold up) Please
Then he said, please, look up in my bag (Look)
There's cook up in my bag, it's all good up in my bag (Here)
And there's more where that came from
I get it from Jose, believe me, there's more where that came from
Yeah, he had 'em lost and the game won (won)
They let him go, yeah, thinkin he would let 'em know (What)
Where Jose was keepin that heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that (Bout that)
And we all know Jose bout that (Bout that)
Next thing you know he seen Jose slouch back (What)
In the chair, like ""There's no way out that"" (Nope)
He said ""Shoot em, I'mma blow they house back"" (Back)
Next day he sent the two way out town (And..)
And somebody blew they house down (Damn)
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side (Word?)
So shorty called Jose, like ""Listen (Listen)
It's going down I need more cocaine"" (Bring it)
So we met up (Met up), it was a set up
Guess who, TJ, Malik, and Boo sped up (Wow)
You should've seen the look on Jose's face
You never seen the look on old man's face (Nope)
Told him no man's great
And it's no man's place, to fuck wit no man's fam

I've been checkin out Big Willie Keith
He been trickin a lot of bills on me
Mmm-hmm!
I think I'mma show him somethin tonight
A lap dance I would say
Yeah, that's what I'mma do
Yeahhhh..


I'm like a freak from Hunt's Point, the Bronx and the Goat
Wear my drawers in tight mode, naked with no coat
Walkin around, I see youse about to lose her
That honey with white boots, and hair like Medusa
Brown-skin fine, I drink her body like wine
And throw the wax on it, and watch two cheeks shine
I drunk a forty, I'm up in here feelin naughty
I like the go-go girl, go 'head work it shorty
I got no time to trick, on the average girl
I'm in paradise, caught up, in the booty world
And for you regular honies, tryin to play fly
I ain't no Chemical no Bank in your human eye
I like my spot, everybody's butt naked
Pump with G-strings, watchin hot momma shake it
I got my beer, viewin from the back rear
Yo brotherman, pass it right over here
I got to ease off the stress, like a eight to five
Keepin it real vexed, them panties wanna get live
Change the pace up, yo Jimmy turn the bass up
Yea yeah yeahhhh

Chorus: Kool Keith + girl (repeat 2X)

Yo baby (whassup?)
Don't crush it when you sit upon it
(Yo baby) whassup?
(Don't rush it when I sit upon it)


I see you scopin me, the fourth time you cut your eye
Let the brother to catch wreck, then tell the man goodbye
I'm next on the menu, runnin up and in you
With seven rubbers on me, don't try to discontinue
We gots to bump and grind, crank up the R. Kelly
Delicious kickin, no leather like I'm Fonzarelli
I order two drinks to think, while you show me pink
Summer Eve breeze and WOO when it don't stink
I'm in the mix, like Funky-master Flex
I'm shootin gizm, then after you can pick up next
I watch you shake it, like palm trees in California
Now you a lady, mature and I'm rubbin on ya
I got my Phantom mask, I'm on the dolo
I slipped in my tip in, and bone a sweetie look like Yo-Yo
She had a good time, knees bent in the chair
She said, ""Get wild - I like it when you pull my hair""
I gave her cream, and rubbed it on her black boots
I see a packed house in different color body suits
I'm in the front row, chillin on the down low
Checkin her dogstyle, she's scoped by an ass pro
I'm from the back kid, smooth with tons of grease
Denver and Texas, and Cali on back to East
She hittin switches, and watch she make it lowride
Zoot, zoot, zzzzzzzt

Chorus 1.5X


It's three o'clock, the morning shift's about to come
Watchin Goldie lapdance, that grey hiney ain't no slum
I gets my workout, my slickest hand from every angle
She's on the job right, cutiepie sippin Tango
I gotta peel for real, a hundred dollar bill
I'm comin straight up, and not for a breakfast meal
This ain't no Burger King, this ain't no White Castle
Not like some ugly girls in Bentleys tryin to give a hassle
I like the slot machine, bustin nuts mean
Slippery wet lubrication like Valvoline
I'm pullin nylon, yo dead up G, to the side
Feelin soft flesh, I'm hard, I'mma let her ride
Jump up and down, get live like House of Pain
Leavin em so wet, the silk with a tan stain
I reach a climax, she's happy with her orgasms
Go on girl!

Wonder if it will ever sleep

Because you briefly look away
Focusing on nothing
So now everything is clear

Because there's no one to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind

And I saw you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You told me time never waits
What is that supposed to mean?


All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And make them into monsoons


And turn them into mon-sooner or later
They'll weave their way back to the sea
Going to finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always do, all into time
Because time never waits


Daddy don't day dream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime

Sonny, do you hear the sound?
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone

Stumbling through the day

We bend and twist this broken mess, yet to see the sun
And now soon you'll see the glory. And I'm proof of living dead
DESTROY WHAT YOU'VE BUILT, GIVE UP THE WILL
(Trust me, cause so far I've stood strong
Trust me cause so far I've stood tall
Just listen when I say.)
This is how we live. This is what we breathe
And it's insulting to my face. It's something I'll take under my wing
I will fly until I sing this free. (Stop, surrender to fate.)
A servant to your dreams, this blood will spill
Ruining your dreams that I despise
I will not strike 'til I see the whites of your eyes
And only then you'll feel the fury
And I'm proof of living dead
This is the one that is the answer to our lives. Look ahead
And even if this never works
(I'll be) satisfied with every motion
And now I am sure I was right

Together we can work this out
We got to love thing
We're talking about


The way you looked at me
Tells me you're sorry
You walked by me
Whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight
You pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me
Just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me
With those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel




The way you tricked me
You know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to hit me
There's no need to fight
Because I gave you everything
I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We got to compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you on
Because everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late




Because I love you boy
And I need you here

Do you wait for ransome notes?
Would you trust him?
Could you trust him?
Trust him like mom with a hot needle
Or do you cut a hole in the roof?
Hell and dump down armfulls of flowers
And flat worms livening up his basement
And maybe his heart starts a-changing
And he starts sniffing flowers
And he lets your girl go with fur coats and shit

You can't make satan prey
You can't sick mom armed with hot needles
You can't shoot guns down the sewer
Or bang on the ceiling angry for god
The devil is alot like you, he's scared up to its horns of happiness
Don't deny yourself mornings
Sing in the face of your enemies

After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family


Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels


Peace King, peace haki, peace queen
I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents
(Rakaa) Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to
The end zone



When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
Create to devastate crew, that's family

""Stay down here where you belong
The folks who live above you don't know right from wrong
To please their king, they've all gone out to war
And not one of them knows what he's fighting for
Way up above they say that I'm a devil and I'm bad
Kings up there are bigger devils than your dad
Breaking the hearts of mothers, making butchers of their brothers
You'll find more heat up there than there is down below""

""Kings up there, they don't care
For the mothers who must stay at home, their troubles to bear
Stay at home, don't you roam

You'll find a lot of people who are not civilized""

They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

So broken in


I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say she's going to be good for you
They throw me, high fives

She says the bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party
And she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane


Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
Say


She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken

Grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

Of all the things that I've read what he wrote me
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping
To be
I keep on keeping it real
Cause it keeps getting easier, he'll see
He's the reason that I'm laughing
Even if there's no one else
He said, you've got to love yourself

You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak
But keep your tongue up in your cheek
And if you stumble on to something better
Remember that it's humble that you seek
You got all the skill you need
Individuality
You got something
Call it gumption
Call it anything you want
Because when you play the fool now
You're only fooling everyone else
You're learning to love yourself

Yes you are, you are, it's you...

There's no price to pay (no, no)
When you give and what you take
That's why it's easy to thank you
You, you...
You, you, you...

Let's say take a break from our day
And get  back to the old garage
Because life's too short anyway
But at least it's better then average
As long as you got me
And I got you
You know we've got a lot to go around
I'll be your friend
Your other brother
Another love to come and comfort you-oo-oo

And I'll keep reminding
If it's the only thing I ever do-oo-oo
I will always love you

You, you, you...
You...

Reflected upon a frozen horizon
Sinister and terminal this hope of desolation

'...Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, of a long lazy summer’s day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman’s money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveler. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper, learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...'

Gli autografi
Chi l'avrebbe mai detto che un giorno avrei firmato gli autografi
Che te ne fai tu del mio autografo?
Non sono il tipo a cui chiedere un autografo
Io sono mister nobody
Mister svela il trucco nell'era del mistero
Nell'era del mistero, lo stress lo spero
Nessuno è più lo stesso
Ci credi o no? Fa lo stesso




Continuo a scrivere
Quando passavo in tv
Tutti quanti mi hanno detto di sorridere
E tu lo sai che racconto robe serie
Ma ti scordi più di me se non mi vedi più in tele
Se non sei più di moda è inutile seguir la moda
Sembri un cane impazzito che si morde la coda
E se credi che io sia cattivo
Credi che Lucio Battisti sia ancora vivo
E credi che nei reality show sia tutto vero
Ma sta gente quando torna a casa piange sul serio
Perché tutto è finto, perché tutto è finito
Sono troppo polemico ho testi implosi
L'infinita leggerezza dell'essere famosi
Quando fai mille prove non dormi e non riposi
E ti ritrovi in questi alberghi lussuosi
Come Marco Pantani con in mano due dosi
E con gli occhi esplosi




Il mio CD
Chi l'avrebbe mai detto che ti scarichi il mio CD
Qua in Italia siamo tanti
Tutti nascono cantanti
Tutti nascono convinti di essere belli, attraenti
E fare cento vetrine (eheh)
Letterine
Letterate
Che ci stanno sono tutte menate
Sono navi arenate tra scogli dello spettacolo
Non fare ciò che ho fatto
Se non sei pratico è un salto acrobatico
Al buio più completo
E poi ti accendono i fari in faccia all'ultimo metro
Non è da me non cercare nessuno
Io sono il tuo fan numero uno
Fammi causa e io ti faccio causa
Questa musica moderna dà la nausea
Fabri Fibra insulta, insulta Fabri Fibra
Ma comunque sono quattro anni che non metto in pausa, raga (raga)

Como un extranjero en su propia quinta
Abre la ventana la rubia lijera
Pero ella solo invita a los que tienen tela

Ganador de la sutileza
Mientras que otros persiguen el oro
Solo me contendo por durar un poco
Sé que esta no es forma ni filosofía
Solo la defensa de mi pobre vida
Tengo esperanzas, no las pierdo
Porque soy un ganador
Pero creo que este año me irá peor
Por eso la otra tarde
Con ánimo de lucha
Yo me fuí p'al centro como quien disfruta
Pero en el 59 aunque iba muy atento
Una mano amiga me rapiñó el vento
No importa me dijo, vamos pa' adelante
Sin tener en cuenta que andaba cesante
Y por andar pensando en esas cosas distraído
No vi ni la sombra de ese colectivo

Traen las hojas en blanco con la cara del barbita

Que hasta el cielo está empeñado
Que levanten ese muerto, San Pedro y sus asociados

"SOBSCBT12AB01838DA","In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory
She left that night
A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in
And then she asked me for a light

Said she had some old business see an old friend
Or maybe make a new start
But the words of her reason they changed with the season
And the truth burned in my heart

It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy
'Cause I knew even then I was caught

I'm caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

So I listen to the wind for the answer
Time hangs heavy on my face
I run from the storm that's on it's way
Until I find there is no place

No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain
Yes I know this time it's too late, now

'Cause I'm caught in the rain again
And I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me

And the rain comes down so silently
And time stand's still like it's in front of me
And the years turn to the rain
And this silence kills me

So now in this one horse town bar
I sing in the back room in the December night
Here she comes through the doorway
With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget

She looks like she knew me
The heat shot through me, melted me down
So we sat and talked about the old days
Or any new things that we found

Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent
We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain

We're caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
Caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

I'm out here on my knees
And my love knows I've been trying
Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying
So I guess she gets me the rain again

And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me

Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
Nothing changed, they know
Realism of life in actually

I know, it get kinda hard sometimes
We all looking for some kind of, outlet
To plug into, but ahh

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
Every hood
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
It's on you
All the haters wanna see
Uh uhn
A niggas life in misery
Uh uhn
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

Handcuffed by the wrist and tied in the feet, so stressed
Wish that I could die in my sleep
And Lord knows, thru his grace I done tried it wit peace
But it's like niggas ain't happy 'til they find me deceased
Feel the grief, of a street, nigga that turned to rap
And just applied Everything that he learned from crack
I'm in now, it's life ain't no turning back, it been foul
So what kinda concerns is that
Peep the signs of the eyes 'cuz it tell it all
One of the few in the Streets that was selling it raw
Made mistakes, but it made me intelligent more
And how I move, you could still look and tell I was poor
How can the hate from another man stop my flow
That's like another pimp thinking he can knock my ho
I'm here now, just trying to copp and blow, couple of cars and lot's of Doe

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

One by one, seen 'em rise, seen 'em fall, you seen one nigga ball
You done seen 'em all
Even standup niggas seen 'em lean and crawl
What makes a man wanna fiend for more
Life itself is more than a trial or a quest
Intelligent wise, it's like I done ran with the best
And very rarely, you can catch me casually - dressed
I'm more relaxed in a hat and some sweats
Doing me, been amongst some of the street's most strongest men
Around for months then they gone again
Incarcerated, penalized for the love of they acts
Criminals, cold-hearted, now what's fucing wit that?
Where we at? hit inside of a life that's rarely exposed
Spoken in codes for the killers that daily'll dose
Get yours, hit a quota then get indoors, get legit
Then hit them stores

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

So now it's on y'all, could see, I figured it out
Only a few could say that they been in my house
And caroused at my wall color, blend with my couch
I'm as low as you can go in the south
When it's too deep, it's hard for the mind to relate
Some say I'm too street and way too involved wit the snakes
What make a man bigger that life, I'm twice his age
Understand I'm a sinner but I'm nice some ways
Knee deep in what I speak 'cuz I spit the truth
I become angelic when I sit in the booth
Just a thought of all the ill sh*t that lurk in streets
How can another real nigga wanna work wit police
Bad enough you got thiefs and the beef is rough
I took an oath just to smoke, eat, sleep and fuck
Knowledge of self, I'mma do this regardless of wealth
Regardless of how the deck and how the cards get dealth

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
All the haters wanna see
A niggas life in misery
But I'mma keep on doing me, 'til I die

What are they saying in our public bazaars?
We are tired of the tune
You must not relent


At every stroke of the bell in the tower, there goes
Another boy from another side
The bulletins that steady come in say those
Familiar words at the top of the hour
The jamming city increases its hum, and those
Terrible words continue to come
Through brass music of government, hear those
Guns tattoo a roll on the drums

No one mentions the neighbouring war
No one knows what their fighting is for
We are tired of the tune
You must not relent


There's this different kind of chemical system, ""2000 Flushes."" Keeps the water crystal clear, keeps the bowl sparkling clean continuously for about 4 months. No rings, no streaks, no stains just put the container in your tank and forget it! Every time you flush, the chlorine crystals dissolve away rust and minerals before dirt rings and stains appear and flushing sure beats brushing!

Don't underestimate

For they must change now or before I burst

Are incomprehensible

Fortunately
I take great pride

No demise
Compromise

But could you even understand my pain
Watching, what is it in your brain that never gets it?
One day I'll disappear to the answer locked in my
Head that you'll never see of feel
A consumer

The more the body is pierced, tortured, wounded, humiliated
The more complete his mans victory over pain
The greater man victory over pain 
The greater his victory over the flesh

That people are a plague

No liability

They torture love come cum they must
Feel the night with the smell of lust
Intoxicates the air
Feel your flesh it makes me whole
It makes me cold your love I stole
The one you hold you'll never know
She sold her soul beware
There all out there now, I'll take you there
There out on the move, ga, ga, god knows where
The dirty girls all bent on pleasure
Extort the greedy sex offenders
Creature comforts never end her
Lust for life for love
The sinful ways of wickedness
Alluring power of decadence
Never lonely loneliness
The affair is never fair
The lights glow far from star to star
In Zanzibar
The calling card, your love is hard in Zanzibar
One look one touch, a touch too much in Zanzibar
The fantasy seems real to me in Zanzibar

"SORUVQF12AB017D220","I have wrestled in the darkness of this lonely pilgrim land
Raising strong and mighty fortresses that I alone command
But these castles I've constructed by the strength of my own hand
Are just temporary kingdoms on foundations made of sand

In the middle of the battle I believe I've finally found
I'll never know the thrill of victory 'til I'm willing to lay down
All my weapons of defense and earthly strategies of war
So I'm laying down my arms and running helplessly to Yours

I surrender all my silent hopes and dreams
Though the price to follow costs me everything
I surrender all my human soul desires
If sacrifice requires
That all my kingdoms fall
I surrender all

If the source of my ambition is the treasure I obtain
If I measure my successes on a scale of earthly gain
If the focus of my vision is the status I attain
My accomplishments are worthless and my efforts are in vain

So I lay aside these trophies to pursue a higher crown
And should You choose somehow to use the life I willingly lay
Down
I surrender all the triumph for it's only by Your grace
I relinquish all the glory, I surrender all the praise

Everything I am, all I've done, and all I've known
Now belongs to You, the life I live is not my own
Just as Abraham laid Isaac on the sacrificial fire
If all I have is all that You desire
I surrender all

Yo, I light up the jar under the light of the stars
And write a few bars until the silence dissolves
Contemplatin' if I'm right or I'm wrong
For dedicatin' most my time to holdin' mics in my palm
My dream has been life long
And though the finish line is still outta sight within my plight I fight on
And I ain't singin' no sob stories of sad songs
I stick to tellin' the total truth and that's all
It's ironic when your rap's best thing
And yet somehow your career is still fledglin'
That's my predicament and it's perplexin'
But instead of sweatin' it I just keep progressin'
While waitin' for the stars to align
In a moment in time when it's my moment to shine
But until then I keep my eyes on the prize
And try to survive night-after-night goin' for mine
Because...


""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time""
(It only takes a moment)
""It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""
(For your life to fly by)
""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time""
(It only takes a moment)
""It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""
(Just to find you're outta time)


And every evening at the end of another day
I'm buckin' the system tryin' to figure out another way
And budget what I gotta pay to phone a lifeline
Hope rainy days don't last my whole lifetime (Please!)
That's why the moonlight is mine
When the moon starts to shine a feelin' moves up my spine
Yeah, I stay in tune with the shadows
Lone trooper on the road less traveled
Lone wolf, sole controller, only soldier still in the battle
Only slave on the boat who's really rowin' his paddle
Still I sit in the saddle and dip from the hassles
Others get rattled and just dibble and dabble
I think bigger, connectin' the dots on the big picture
Like identifyin' the Big Dipper
Fueled by haters' comments and one day I promise
That I'll light up the sky like Halley's Comet


""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time""
(It only takes a moment)
""It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""
(For your life to fly by)
Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years (It only takes a moment)
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears (Just to find your outta time)



I hope the struggle don't murder me
Before I find out how many people heard of V
From Jersey to Germany
And yeah, I try to act fine as though all is well
But at times I feel like a snowball in hell
I'm tryin' to find my way, that's why it's all grunt work
Got no time for play, no time for games
So while my time remains I won't wait like a time delay
I say what I mean and mean what I say
Chasin' dreams night-by-night and day-after-day
I met a broad at the titty bar
Called 'Starlight' because her eyes twinkled like little stars
She had a smile that could shine for a million years
I told her I got a trail of a trillion tears
Ask if she could help me make it disappear
And felt no fear, when she said this here, she said


""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time""
(It only takes a moment)
""It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""
(For your life to fly by)
Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years (It only takes a moment)
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears (Just to find your outta time)

The christening

Streets of the dead
With a chip on my shoulder
And a voice in my head

Though you don't know what for

Well the mystery train is coming
Right to your door

Have to walk so proud

Can take you where
You can cry like an angel

When we played stump the band
We were raising each other
In a strange land
There were hard pills to swallow
But we drank 'em all down

And now they're a little too long

Keep your eyes on the sky

It's not your ideal
May we all find salvation
In professions that heal

We've had our differences
Now it's time to patch things up
We've been through trying times
Though the going got so rough
Give thanks and praise that we have made it
Making a new start
I know a place for you baby
Deep inside my heart

We're on that magic road
We need each other so
Never to let go
It's love for ever more

So much wasted time
On who that it was to blame
And now that we've both realised
Before it was too late
This time around yes we can make it
I feel it in the air
I'm coming home to a special lady
She'll be waiting

CHORUS

House of Love ( Repeat X 5)

This adoration yes is safe and sound my friend
Compassion built on solid ground
Oh it's joy for both of us to reconcile
Oh yeah under one roof together side by side

(Verse 1)
While we continuously stay sculpturin bombs
Love unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggas I'mma die tryin for y'all
With the blessing of an angel's tear cryin' for y'all
Back to the foundation, takin you under back where it all started
With a whole new beginnin and a brand new hunger
Starvin to where my skin was suffocatin my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decoratin my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifesto, shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought y'all meet a nigga that could be this real
Flipmode up in this bitch now let me make you aware
Too late for turnin back my nigga cause we takin it there




Genesis, Genesis, Genesis
And leave!

(Verse 2)
And leave a mark until it's deep in the floor
Y'all niggas fucked up never should've let let me get my feet in the door
And then I step through, FUCK wipin my feet at the door
I be the deacon I'm beatin niggas and speakin the raw
Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin me for
Testin my strength, that's what the devil's try to weaken me for
C'mon, yes and y'all off to the next step.. for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like somethin that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu'fuckas probably wouldn't believe us
Flipmode Squad by all means, a pledge of allegiance
With the great feelin of people like the comin of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be tellin you nothin
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, swearin smacked dead on a cross
Kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
Chop ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes I think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang startin for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin for me
When I spit you know I always love to garnish it hard
While you love-it hate-it niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to y'all
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to y'all
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin it there

I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door


When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
Like pendulums swinging on chains
I tried to give you everything
That your heart was longing for
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door


I’m going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door


Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before

Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot

We'll never fade away

I will tear down myself, I won't fade

It's all just to save your face

And another one will fall down

Fall down, fall down
Stare back into my own eyes
Fall down, fall down
A stranger in my own skin
Fall down, fall down

One decade later
And another one must fall down
The earth isn't humming
I watched them all fall down
Fell into the sound in front of me
Unchanged by those around
Directionless
An open sea
We'll watch as time tumbles down

The sun in the open sky
Fall down, fall down
Stare back into my own eyes
Fall down, fall down

Ich nicke und weiß nicht wovon wir eigentlich Reden
Aber gut das wollte ich ja erreichen
Du hast jetzt Vertrauen zu mir und ich einen Steifen
Ich überlege mir ob du beim Ficken auch so lächelst oder böse guckst
Du bist dir sicher das ich ehrlich bin, ich bin mir sicher das du Penis lutschst
Denn du machst auf Mauernblümchen, doch du trägst nichts drunter
Und verträgst keinen Alk, wirst allmählich Munter
Baby, nimm mal deinen Mut zusammen
Und gesteh's dir ein wir beide passen gut zusammen
Denn du siehst heiß aus und ich hab Bling-Bling
Steig in den Porsche es macht ""Wremm Wremm""


Komm mit, steig ein
Scheiß drauf, komm rein
Trink aus, entspann dich
Leg dich hin

Nimm sie an die Hand, nimm sie in deinem Cabrio mit
Nimm sie in deine Bar, nimm sie dann in dein Barrio mit
Nimm sie in den Arm, nimm sie dann gleich beim Wort
Nimm sie auf dem Küchentisch, auf der Kommode, an jedem erdenklichen Ort


Zum Glück kann ich dich nicht mehr reden hören durch den Fahrtwind
Ich fahr so schnell ich kann direkt zu meinem Appartement
Erst steigen wir aus meiner Karre, dann aus den Klamotten
Ich kann’s nicht mehr erwarten endlich anzufangen zu poppen
Du trägst bloß noch deine High-Heels, ich bloß noch meine Karate-Hose
Du willst schon allein anfangen? ich hole nur noch die Schokoladensoße
Ich wusste doch niemand lässt meine Massage kalt
Oh mein Gott, Mädchen - du bist halb Mensch, halb Blasebalg
Du hast nen wunderschönen Popo, ich will dich von hinten stopfen
Gib es einfach zu, du stehst auf Schinkenklopfen
Du bist gelenkig das Zimmer wird zum Zirkuszelt
Ich dachte Frauen machen so was nur für unerhört viel Geld




Ich glaub' ich wurd noch nie so rührend geweckt
Erst krieg ich noch einen Job und dann Frühstück ans Bett
Mir ist schon klar das ich jetzt einen Platz in deinem Herzen hab'
Das hat dir doch gefallen gestern mit dem Kerzenwachs
Erst hast du Sperma und dann Blut geleckt
Es hat dir gut geschmeckt, du weißt jetzt ich bin gut im Bett
Du hast gecheckt das ich es dir besorgen kann
Jaja, ich rufe dich dann morgen an...

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing

I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience'
Has gotten such rotten responses""

And it seems like the media
Immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, ‘cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph

My God, August came around



Summer comes and leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel like life is real
And hanging on for more

Empty streets, empty me
Just call me vagabond
Wondering in the sun

This is getting sort of old
Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets or empty me?



Hanging, hanging
Holding on for me
Hoping, praying this will all start over

Come back for me
We'll walk the streets of this old town
Make me a promise this will all come back around

And you feel like shining

Better plan all day

Better plan all week

Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that

I can see your eyes
I can see your brain

You're still hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween

You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months

Remember what I did
Remember what I was
Back on Halloween

But what's in between
Where are your ideas
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not everyday
Are you so afraid
What will people say


After Halloween

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through
But what will the boss say to you

And what will your girlfriend say to you
And the people out on the street they might glare at you
And what do you know you're pretty self-conscious too

So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations
And shove 'em up your ass

Many rap groups attempt to latch to the popular cultures statutes
And thus they detach their roots from the soil that kept them loose
And made what they delivered so true

There's a desert waste land of past artists that's so cruel
Feeling thrown out like woody in toy story two
And yo we felt that but let me tell you Satan, he dealt that
I think it's time to give him his deck back, c'mon now

I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)

I have been a thousand places
Seen a million faces since the last time
(Since the last time)

Schamlos nimmt der dreiste Dieb
Denn er ist seines Glьckes Schmied

In the belly of the beast in dis ya struggle
Dem chopping down OUR role models
In the belly of the beast in dis ya struggle
Dem a cutting down OUR role models

Cause every single time we make a stance now yeah arrh!
They always try their very best to catch us with our pants down woe
Want to smear our name
And denounce our fame
It's a crying shame
Hatred still remains
I'm charging dem rascals for libel and slander oh!

Check your plots and schemes in your game shows
To turn our heroes into zero's
Know your tricks and deeds
Want to kill the seeds
That we plant and grow
Why you stoop so low
I'm charging them rascals for libel and slander oh!

CHORUS

DJ RAP........
Listen to the thing that I'm about to confess
I hate and I despise and I deplore and detest
The tabloids and newspapers better known as the press
And so much propaganda that it leads to distress
Magic Johnson, Micheal Jordan, boom your the best
Advice to Micheal jackson keep your cards to your chest
Mr Iron Mike Tyson always under arrest
And vote fi Jesse Jackson him a next president
The plight of OJ Simpson caused a civil unrest
Police beat up Rodney King until his face was a mess
Defend yourself by any means and Malcolm say yes
I dare a man to ever curse a who JAH JAH bless
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
Dem just a mud up, mud up
Blood up blood up etc

Up ye mighty race
And wipe the dirt from your face
Never ever fall from grace
The mind is a terrible thing to waste (repeat)

In dis ya struggle
OUR role models

Somehow I'm made perfect in this fracture

As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate


They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate


A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Off of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate


He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate


He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate


People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

I don't mind, it's true, hey


Never was on time, yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago and darling, I don't mind
Yeah, we were just two friends in lust
And baby, that just don't mean much
Oh yeah, you trained me not to love
After you showed me what it was


Now she's staring wide-eyed, can't close her eyes (Say what?)
Anywhere is fine, just don't waste my time
You see, my uncle would say
""Things would change once he's dead""


""Meet me in the bathroom"", that's what she said
I don't mind, it's true


Never was on time, yes, I once was mine
Well, that was long ago and darling, I don't mind
Yeah, they were just two fucks in lust
Oh, baby, that just don't mean much
Oh yeah, you trained me not to love
After you taught me what it was

Sometimes in life you don't see straight
Pray to Him and He will show

When your head is in a certain place
Nobody around to make you say
Stand strong and you will grow

Oooh Wait til you see my smile
Oooh Wait til they see your smile

Don't they love to see you down?
Kick you while you're on the ground
Don't let emotions show

People always speculate
Don't let it get in your way
They say things they don't know

Oooh Wait til you see my smile
Oooh Wait til they see your smile

Hey
So you're doing better now
Everybody comes around
But you don't really need 'em much
'Cause you're stronger and you're better
And you're ready for whatever (Say)

Oooh Wait til you see my smile
Oooh Wait til they see your smile

Oooh Wait til you see my smile
Oooh Wait til they see your smile

"SOWCLTO12A67021CEC","Alright, (hmm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years
Since we last seen each other
Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
Cuz everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Chorus

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now
(See now that I found the love of my life)
(I don't have to trick no more)
Girl, it was nice seein' you
But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Chorus to fade
